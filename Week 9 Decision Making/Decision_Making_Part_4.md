### Week 9: Decision Making – Part 4

---

### Recap of Previous Lectures:

1. **Approaches to Decision-Making**:

   - **Rational** vs. **Intuitive** approaches and the concept of **bounded rationality**.
2. **Barriers to Decision-Making**:

   - Fear of taking risks or uncertainty about decision authority.
3. **Decision-Making Biases**:

   - Cognitive biases that distort judgment, leading to suboptimal decisions.
4. **Individual vs. Group Decision-Making**:

   - Pros and cons of each, focusing on **group consensus** and the **time commitment** required.
5. **Group Decision-Making Techniques**:

   - **Nominal Group Technique**, **Delphi Technique**, and **Ringi Technique**—methods that enhance democratic, unbiased decision-making.

### 1. **Majority Rule in Group Decision-Making**:

One common method in group decision-making is the use of **voting** or determining the solution by majority opinion. While it seems simple and time-saving, **majority rule** has several inherent problems.

#### Problems with Majority Rule:

1. **Majority Opinion May Be Incorrect**:

   - The opinion of the majority isn’t always technically sound. A **minority member** with the right solution can be pressured into agreeing with the majority, leading to poor decision-making.
   - The best idea may come from a minority voice, but if the group doesn’t listen, the team risks ignoring the optimal solution.
2. **Pressure on Minority Members**:

   - Members with minority views may feel **alienated** or like outcasts, creating a poor **communication climate**. This can suppress creativity and innovation, as members may hesitate to voice dissenting opinions in future discussions.
3. **Preference Variability**:

   - Simple yes/no voting may not capture the full spectrum of opinions. Some members might mildly agree, strongly agree, or be uncertain, but the binary voting system forces them into a **limited framework**.
   - This lack of granularity can stifle **creativity**. For example, instead of choosing between two options, the group might have been able to combine elements of both solutions for a better outcome.
4. **Subgroup Formation and Politicking**:

   - Majority rule can encourage the formation of **coalitions** or **subgroups**, especially when personal interests or alliances are involved. Members may side with a powerful individual or group for personal gain, rather than supporting the best idea.
   - This can harm **group cohesiveness** and create unhealthy team dynamics.

### 2. **Common Decision-Making Traps in Groups**:

Several pitfalls can occur when groups make decisions together, leading to poor outcomes.

#### 1. **Groupthink**:

- **Groupthink** occurs when team members conform to the majority view to maintain harmony and avoid conflict, even if they personally disagree. This often happens in very **cohesive groups** where members value group unity over making the best decision.
- **Symptoms of Groupthink**:
  - **Overestimation of the Group**: Members develop overconfidence, believing the group cannot fail.
  - **Close-mindedness**: The group disregards outside opinions, considering them irrelevant or hostile.
  - **Pressure for Uniformity**: There is pressure on all members to align with the majority view, creating an environment where dissent is discouraged.
- **Consequences**: This can lead to disastrous decisions, such as the **Apollo 13 rocket failure**, where concerns raised by an engineer were ignored due to groupthink.

   **How to Avoid Groupthink**:

- Leaders should encourage diverse opinions, ensure open communication, and make the group more **heterogeneous** by including members with varied perspectives.

#### 2. **Abilene Paradox**:

- The **Abilene Paradox** is a form of groupthink in which all members of a group privately disagree with a decision but go along with it to avoid conflict.
- In this scenario, the group collectively makes a decision that **nobody** supports, but everyone assumes others want it. It’s a failure to challenge decisions, resulting in a situation where consensus is prioritized over good judgment.
- **Cause**: Fear of confrontation or disturbing group harmony.

#### 3. **Escalation of Commitment**:

- **Escalation of commitment** refers to a group’s tendency to continue investing in a failing decision, even when it’s clear that the chosen path is not working. This happens more frequently in groups than individuals.
- **Example**: A company starts building a large power plant but realizes halfway through that it’s not feasible. Instead of halting the project, they continue pouring resources into it, hoping to salvage it, despite knowing it’s doomed to fail.

   **Reasons for Escalation of Commitment**:

- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Group members don’t want to abandon a project because they’ve already invested significant time, money, and effort, even though continuing will likely result in further losses.
- **Ego and Reputation**: Admitting failure can hurt the group's or individual members' egos and reputations.
- **Confirmation Bias**: Groups may selectively seek out information that supports their initial decision and ignore warning signs that the project is failing.
- **Perception of Recovery**: Members may believe setbacks are temporary and the situation will improve, much like gamblers believe they will eventually win back their losses.

   **How to Avoid Escalation of Commitment**:

- **Set clear limits**: Establish predefined limits on how much time or resources to invest before re-evaluating a decision.
- **Avoid ambiguity**: Define milestones clearly, with specific goals and timeframes to track progress.
- **External reviewers**: Have third-party reviewers evaluate progress to provide unbiased feedback and prevent internal biases from clouding judgment.
- **Accept sunk costs**: Acknowledge when resources are lost and move forward, rather than throwing good money after bad.
- **Manage emotions**: Keep emotions out of decision-making to avoid attachment to failed projects.

### Conclusion:

In this final part of the decision-making chapter, we explored the **pitfalls of majority rule** and several common traps like **groupthink**, the **Abilene paradox**, and **escalation of commitment**. Each of these traps illustrates how team dynamics can lead to poor decisions if not managed effectively. Structured techniques like **Nominal Group** and **Delphi methods**, combined with strong leadership and clear goals, can help teams avoid these pitfalls and make more effective decisions.
