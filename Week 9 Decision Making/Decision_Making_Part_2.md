### Decision Making – Part 2

---

#### Recap of Part 1:

- **Decision-making approaches**: Rational and intuitive approaches.
- **Bounded rationality**: The limitations of rational decision-making due to incomplete information and cognitive constraints.
- **Barriers to decision-making**: Factors like avoiding decisions, complacency, procrastination, and buck-passing were discussed.

#### 1. **Biases in Decision-Making**:

Biases are distortions or limitations in decision-making processes that affect the quality of decisions.

1. **Framing Bias**:

   - The way a problem or situation is presented can heavily influence decisions.
   - **Example**: Presenting drug side effects as "2% of people" versus "4 million people" changes perception, even though the numbers are equivalent. The latter may sound alarming because of the large number.
   - This bias is common in marketing, persuasion, and negotiations where information is presented selectively to sway decisions.
2. **Prospect Theory**:

   - Based on risk aversion, **prospect theory** suggests that people weigh potential losses more heavily than potential gains.
   - **Example**: A manager may avoid a risky investment even if it has a high chance of success, because the fear of failure is more impactful than the potential for profit.
3. **Representativeness Bias**:

   - People make decisions based on **stereotypes** or generalized assumptions rather than actual data.
   - **Example**: Assuming men make better drivers or women make better nurses due to societal stereotypes rather than individual capabilities.
4. **Availability Bias**:

   - Decisions are based on readily available information in one’s memory, even if that information is not fully accurate or complete.
   - **Example**: A person may invest in a well-known company due to its past reputation without considering recent financial struggles.
5. **Anchoring and Adjustment Bias**:

   - This occurs when an initial figure or piece of information serves as an anchor, heavily influencing subsequent decisions.
   - **Example**: In negotiations, if a seller quotes a very high price, buyers might negotiate to a lower price, but still above what would be fair, as they adjust their expectations based on the initial anchor.
6. **Overconfidence Bias**:

   - Individuals tend to overestimate the accuracy of their knowledge or judgments, often leading to poor decisions.
   - **Example**: A manager may ignore crucial data because they have made similar decisions successfully in the past, underestimating new variables in the current situation.

### 2. **Individual vs. Group Decision-Making**:

#### Individual Decision-Making:

- **Advantages**:

  - Quick decision-making, which is critical in emergencies.
  - Works well when the decision-maker is an expert with deep knowledge of the issue.
  - No need to convince or seek consensus from others, making the process faster and more efficient.
- **Disadvantages**:

  - Lack of diversity in perspectives.
  - Can lead to decisions that lack buy-in from others in the organization.

#### Group Decision-Making:

- **Advantages**:

  - More **participation** and **commitment**: When group members are involved, they are more likely to feel committed to the decision and its implementation.
  - **Synergy**: Groups can combine the strengths of various individuals, leading to better, more well-rounded decisions. This collective effort often leads to solutions greater than the sum of individual contributions (Gestalt principle: "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts").
  - **Transparency and fairness**: Group decision-making enhances perceptions of fairness, as all members are involved in the process. This aligns with the concept of **procedural justice**.
- **Disadvantages**:

  - **Time-consuming**: Reaching a consensus in groups can be slow, especially when multiple opinions or disagreements arise.
  - **Risk of conflict**: Different viewpoints may lead to conflict, and sensitive topics can make group dynamics challenging.
  - **Risk-taking**: Groups may take greater risks because accountability is spread among members, reducing individual responsibility.

#### Best Team Member vs. The Team:

- Teams with star performers might not always succeed unless the team processes are effective.
- Teams that maximize the contributions of **every member**, including leveraging star performers without relying solely on them, tend to achieve greater success.
- **Example**: In sports, teams with mediocre individual players but strong teamwork often outperform those with star players who don’t collaborate well.

### 3. **Group Decision-Making Processes**:

1. **Group Dynamics**:

   - Effective group decision-making requires strong group processes, including clear communication, role definitions, and leadership. A good leader can help balance differing viewpoints and steer the group toward a cohesive decision.
2. **Nature of the Problem**:

   - Not all problems require group input. Some decisions are best made by individuals, especially when the problem is specialized or highly technical. However, for complex or sensitive issues, group input may provide more balanced solutions.
3. **Risk-Taking in Groups**:

   - Groups tend to take more risks because the **responsibility** is diffused across members. If a decision fails, no single individual is blamed, reducing the fear of failure. This can encourage bold decisions but also risky ones.
   - Individual decision-makers are often more **cautious** since they bear full responsibility for the outcomes.

---

### Conclusion:

- **Biases** play a significant role in distorting decisions, whether made by individuals or groups. Being aware of these biases helps in making more informed and rational decisions.
- **Group decision-making** can harness collective intelligence and improve outcomes but may suffer from slow processes and riskier choices. **Individual decision-making** is often faster and more focused but can lack the breadth of perspectives.
- The context, nature of the problem, and organizational culture determine which decision-making method (individual or group) is more suitable.
