### Decision Making – Part 1

---

#### Overview:

This lecture begins Chapter 10 of the Organizational Behaviour course, focusing on **Decision Making**. Key topics covered include:

1. Different approaches to decision making.
2. Barriers and biases in decision making.
3. Group vs. individual decision-making processes.
4. Group decision-making techniques and problems like groupthink, the Abilene paradox, and escalation of commitment.

### Key Concepts of Decision Making:

#### 1. **Importance of Decision Making in Organizations**:

- Decision making is central in both **individuals** and **organizations**. It affects many stakeholders, and therefore, organizational decisions must be made carefully.
- Managers typically make crucial decisions, either individually or in groups. Group decisions may involve consensus or input from different organizational levels.

#### 2. **Definition of Decision Making**:

- Decision making involves selecting the most suitable option from multiple alternatives or resolving a problem using available or novel solutions.

#### 3. **Rational Decision-Making Approach**:

- The **rational approach** is the most desirable method for organizations.
- Steps include collecting all relevant information, weighing pros and cons, and systematically analyzing data to arrive at a decision.
- **Challenges** to rational decision making include:
  - Inability to access all necessary information.
  - Difficulty defining the problem accurately.
  - Subjectivity in interpreting qualitative data (e.g., customer preferences).
  - Limitations in tools and technology for processing large data sets.
- **Bounded Rationality**: Herbert Simon’s concept that decision-making is limited by information, cognitive limitations, and time constraints. Thus, even rational decisions are **bounded** and cannot be 100% optimal.

#### 4. **Intuitive Decision-Making Approach**:

- This approach relies on **gut feeling** or intuition rather than detailed analysis.
- **Advantages**: Fast decision-making, often based on experience.
- **Disadvantages**: Risky due to lack of data-backed justification. If it fails, the consequences can be high.
- There’s an ongoing debate between the effectiveness of **rational** (data-driven) versus **intuitive** (gut-based) decision-making in managerial contexts.

#### 5. **Non-Rational Decision-Making Approaches**:

   These approaches acknowledge the limitations of pure rationality:

- **Satisficing Approach**:
  - Coined by Herbert Simon, it involves selecting a solution that is "good enough" rather than optimal.
  - Common when time and resources are constrained.
- **Incremental Approach**:
  - Small, temporary solutions are implemented to solve immediate problems without addressing long-term consequences.
  - Example: Quick fixes like patching a leaking tap instead of replacing it.
- **Garbage-Can Model**:
  - Decisions are made haphazardly or by trial and error. Sometimes, irrelevant actions yield effective outcomes.
  - Common in contexts where organizations rely on random solutions, such as restarting a phone to fix technical issues.

### Barriers to Decision Making:

#### 1. **Avoiding Decision-Making**:

- **Avoidance**: Postponing decisions, hoping future events will clarify the situation.
- **Non-Decision**: Failing to make a decision when necessary, often due to fear of failure or risk aversion.

#### 2. **Fear of Failure**:

- Some avoid decisions to evade potential blame if things go wrong.
- **Risk aversion** is common in individuals and organizations, where the fear of losing outweighs potential gains.

#### 3. **Failure to Acknowledge Problems**:

- **Complacency**: Ignoring early signs of problems due to overconfidence in current success.
- Example: A small dip in profits might be rationalized as insignificant when in reality, it could indicate larger issues.

#### 4. **Defensive Avoidance**:

- **Procrastination**: Delaying decisions in hopes the problem will resolve itself or until more favorable conditions emerge.
- **Buck Passing**: Shifting the responsibility for decision-making onto others.
- Example: In high employee attrition, organizations may rationalize the problem by blaming industry trends rather than addressing internal issues.

#### 5. **Panic and Anxiety**:

- **Panic**: Fear of making the wrong decision under pressure may paralyze individuals or organizations, preventing any decision.
- **Role Confusion**: In some situations, no one in the organization is sure of who is responsible for making the decision, leading to inaction.

### Decision-Making Biases:

In addition to barriers, the lecture briefly touches on how cognitive biases affect decision-making, such as **overconfidence**, **confirmation bias**, and **status quo bias**. These biases can distort judgment, leading individuals to make suboptimal decisions or avoid them altogether.

---

### Key Takeaways:

- **Rationality is bounded**: No decision-making process is perfectly rational due to inherent limitations.
- **Non-rational approaches**, while risky, are often employed due to practical constraints.
- **Decision-making barriers** like avoidance, procrastination, and defensive avoidance can lead to significant organizational issues if not addressed.
