### **Week 9: Decision-Making**

#### **Approaches in Decision Making**:

1. **Rational Approach**:

   - Involves gathering all possible information and analyzing it to make the most optimal decision.
2. **Bounded Rationality**:

   - Recognizes the limitations in gathering and processing all necessary information, leading to decisions that are "rational" within those constraints.
3. **Non-Rational Approaches**:

   - **Satisficing Approach**: Settling for a satisfactory solution rather than an optimal one.
   - **Incremental Approach**: Making small adjustments to reduce the problem to a manageable level.
   - **Garbage-Can Approach**: Making decisions in a seemingly random pattern due to unclear goals or information.

#### **Barriers to Effective Decision-Making**:

- **Not Accepting the Problem**:

  - Includes **complacency**, **defensive avoidance**, **rationalization**, **procrastination**, **buck passing**, and **panic**.
- **Not Deciding to Decide**: Avoiding or delaying decisions due to uncertainty or fear of responsibility.

#### **Decision-Making Biases**:

- **Framing**: Decisions are influenced by how a problem is presented.
- **Prospect Theory**: The pain of loss is often perceived as greater than the potential gain.
- **Representativeness**: Relying on stereotypes to assess the likelihood of an event.
- **Availability**: Judging based on how easily similar instances come to mind.
- **Anchoring and Adjustment**: Allowing an initial figure to overly influence the final decision.
- **Overconfidence**: Being excessively certain of one’s own judgment.

### **Decision Making in Teams**

#### Steps in Team Decision Making:

1. **Orientation**:

   - Define the problem, set goals, and plan for the decision-making process.
2. **Discussion**:

   - Gather and evaluate information, identify alternatives, and discuss them.
3. **Decision Making**:

   - Choose the group’s solution.
4. **Implementation**:

   - Adhere to the decision, evaluate its effectiveness, and seek feedback.

#### **Individual vs Group Decision Making**:

- **Synergy**: The idea that a team’s collective output can be greater than individual contributions.
- **Role of Leadership**: The importance of leadership in guiding group processes.
- **Risk Taking**: Groups tend to take more risks because the responsibility is shared.

### **Group Decision-Making Techniques**:

1. **Nominal Group Technique**: Structured idea generation and ranking by individual members before group discussion.
2. **Delphi Method**: Expert-based decision-making through multiple rounds of anonymous input and feedback.
3. **Ringi Technique**: A democratic approach where middle management makes decisions, and top management provides feedback.

### **Problems with Majority Rule**:

- **Level of Preference May Vary**: Majority decisions may not reflect the intensity of individual preferences.
- **Blocks Creativity**: Reduces the opportunity for nuanced or creative solutions.
- **Formation of Coalitions**: Subgroup formations can lead to politicking and influence decision-making.

---

### **Groupthink**:

- Occurs when the desire for harmony or conformity results in irrational decision-making.
- **Symptoms**:
  - **Overestimation**: Believing the group is superior and cannot fail.
  - **Close-Mindedness**: Ignoring outside opinions.
  - **Pressure Toward Uniformity**: Expecting all members to agree.

---

### **The Abilene Paradox**:

- Occurs when group members adopt a decision without challenging it because they wish to avoid conflict, resulting in poor decision-making.
- **Pluralistic Ignorance**: Individuals go along with what they think the group wants, even if they privately disagree.

---

### **Escalation of Commitment**:

- The tendency to continue investing in a losing proposition due to the effort, time, and money already spent (**sunk costs**).
- **Non-Rational Escalation**: Continuing a failed decision simply because of the previous investment.

**Avoiding Escalation**:

- Set limits, avoid ambiguity, bring in external reviewers, accept sunk costs, and manage emotions.

---

### **Group Polarization**:

- The tendency for groups to make more extreme decisions than individuals might make alone.
