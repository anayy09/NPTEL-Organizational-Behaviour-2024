### Week 9: Decision Making – Part 3

---

### Recap of Previous Lectures:

- **Approaches to Decision Making**:

  - **Rational approach**: Structured, data-driven, but limited by bounded rationality.
  - **Intuitive approach**: Quick, experience-based but risky and less systematic.
- **Barriers to Effective Decision Making**:

  - **Risk avoidance**: Fear of being blamed for wrong decisions leads to decision paralysis.
  - **Complacency**: Avoiding decisions because the current situation seems satisfactory.
  - **Procrastination and buck-passing**: Delaying decisions or shifting responsibility.
- **Decision-Making Biases**:

  - Over-reliance on memory, stereotypes, and typical situations can distort decisions.
- **Individual vs. Group Decision Making**:

  - Each has pros and cons. Group decision-making is often slower but promotes buy-in and transparency.

### 1. **Team Decision-Making**:

Unlike individual decision-making, **team decision-making** is usually a more structured, formal process within organizations. It involves multiple steps, which help define how decisions are made, depending on the nature of the problem, team size, and objectives.

#### Steps in Team Decision-Making:

1. **Orientation**:

   - **Definition**: The team members familiarize themselves with the problem and work toward a common understanding.
   - **Consensus**: It’s crucial that all members agree on the problem’s definition to avoid later conflicts and misaligned solutions.
   - **Challenges**: This stage can be hindered by the **hidden profile paradigm**, where some team members have unique or hidden information that may not be shared, and **common information bias**, where only shared information is discussed while critical, less-known details are ignored.
2. **Goal Setting**:

   - **Setting Timelines and Methods**: The team defines goals not just for the solution but also for the process, such as timelines and methods for decision-making.
   - **Importance of Structure**: Without clear goals, team decision-making can become prolonged, so setting milestones and ensuring progress is critical.
   - **Leadership**: A team leader or coordinator should ensure these goals are met by reinforcing milestones and keeping the group on track.
3. **Discussion**:

   - **Information Sharing**: Team members discuss and prioritize information to come up with alternatives and evaluate them.
   - **Biases and Conflict**: This stage is prone to interpersonal conflict and biases like the hidden profile and common information bias.
   - **Leadership Role**: The leader must ensure equal participation, open discussion, and prevent personal conflicts from affecting team dynamics.
4. **Decision Making**:

   - **Choosing the Right Alternative**: Once all alternatives are evaluated, the team selects the best option.
   - **Challenges**: Strong personalities or leaders may unduly influence decisions, and time pressures may force hasty decisions. Some team members may remain silent out of fear of looking foolish, leading to suboptimal outcomes.
5. **Implementation and Evaluation** (if applicable):

   - Teams that are responsible for implementing decisions must ensure they **sell the solution** to others and evaluate its effectiveness post-implementation. Feedback should be sought to improve future decision-making processes.

### 2. **Techniques for Team Decision-Making**:

Several structured techniques help teams avoid common pitfalls and biases in decision-making.

#### 1. **Nominal Group Technique (NGT)**:

- **Process**:

  1. The team leader presents the problem, and each member writes down their ideas or solutions independently.
  2. These ideas are collected and ranked individually by each member.
  3. Once ranked, the team discusses the rankings and reaches a decision based on collective input.
- **Advantages**:

  - Reduces the influence of powerful team members early in the process, as the first stages involve individual reflection rather than group discussion.
  - Provides a ranked list of alternatives, allowing for a backup plan if the first solution doesn’t work.
- **Minimizes Power Dynamics**: Since the initial phases are conducted independently, powerful individuals like managers or leaders don’t have undue influence on the group.

#### 2. **Delphi Technique**:

- **Used for**: Forecasting and prediction, especially in technical or change management contexts.
- **Process**:

  1. Experts submit their individual opinions and predictions on a particular issue.
  2. These responses are circulated to the group for feedback and further refinement.
  3. Several rounds of feedback occur, often without face-to-face meetings, to prevent biases from personal influence.
- **Advantages**:

  - Experts remain uninfluenced by social dynamics or power structures because communication is usually anonymous or through documentation.
  - Especially useful for long-term predictions and technical forecasts.

#### 3. **Ringi Technique**:

- **Used in Japanese organizations** and involves a democratic decision-making process that emphasizes consensus at the middle-management level.
- **Process**:

  1. Middle-level managers collaboratively make a decision.
  2. This decision is passed to upper management for review and comment.
  3. The decision is revised as necessary based on feedback and then implemented.
- **Advantages**:

  - Promotes democracy within the organization by ensuring decisions from middle management are respected by upper management.
  - Top management only serves as advisors or reviewers, reinforcing the decisions made by the middle-level team.

### 3. **Challenges in Team Decision-Making**:

1. **Hidden Profile and Common Information Bias**:

   - Unique and critical information may remain hidden if teams focus on commonly shared information, which can lead to ineffective decisions.
2. **Time Pressure and Fatigue**:

   - Teams can become rushed or fatigued, particularly if earlier stages like goal setting and discussion are not handled efficiently. This can lead to poor decisions being made under time constraints.
3. **Power Dynamics**:

   - Strong leaders or influential team members can sway decisions unfairly. Structured techniques like the **nominal group technique** help mitigate this issue by keeping the early stages independent of group influence.

### Conclusion:

Team decision-making is a structured, multi-step process that must be managed carefully to avoid biases and inefficiencies. Techniques like the **nominal group**, **Delphi**, and **Ringi methods** offer structured approaches to ensure fairness, reduce the impact of power dynamics, and arrive at well-informed decisions.
