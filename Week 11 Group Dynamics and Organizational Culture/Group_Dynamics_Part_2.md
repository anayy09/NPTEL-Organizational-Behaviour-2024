### **Group Dynamics (Part 2)**

**Focus of the Lecture**:

- Stages of team development.
- Key problems encountered in teams, such as free riding, social loafing, and groupthink.

### **1. Recap of Group and Team Concepts**

- **Groups vs. Teams**: Teams are a subset of groups, characterized by formal structure and a focus on work contexts.

  - **Groups** may have larger sizes and less formal structure.
  - **Teams** are more cohesive, structured, and interdependent.
- **Different Types of Teams**: Teams can vary based on cohesiveness, task interdependence, and boundedness.

### **2. Stages of Group Development (Tuckman and Jensen Model)**

This model describes how teams evolve over time through five key stages.

#### **1. Forming Stage**

- **Description**: This is the initial stage when members come together for the first time.
- **Main Focus**:
  - Members **orient themselves** to each other, both formally (understanding roles, tasks, hierarchy) and informally (understanding personal work styles, preferences).
  - Formal orientation is often facilitated by the leader or through manuals and documentation.
  - Informal orientation involves personal interaction, learning about each other's behaviors, values, and work habits.
- **Synergy**: The goal is to achieve synergy, where the collective effort of the team results in better outcomes than individual contributions.

#### **2. Storming Stage**

- **Description**: This is a period of **conflict** and **confusion**.
- **Challenges**:
  - Ambiguity about roles and expectations can lead to **misunderstandings** and interpersonal conflicts.
  - **Task conflict** can occur when members disagree on what tasks to perform and how to perform them.
- **Leader's Role**:
  - The leader plays a crucial role in resolving conflicts, creating a tolerant culture, and facilitating adaptation among team members.
  - If conflicts are unresolved, the team may fail to progress to the next stage.

#### **3. Norming Stage**

- **Description**: The team begins to establish **unwritten rules** and norms, reducing conflict and increasing cohesion.
- **Key Outcomes**:
  - Norms around behavior, task roles, and acceptable actions emerge, providing the team with structure and reducing uncertainty.
  - Members agree on how deviant behavior should be handled, and these norms guide team behavior moving forward.

#### **4. Performing Stage**

- **Description**: The team now works smoothly and focuses on task performance.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **High cohesiveness** and synergy among team members.
  - Conflicts are minimal, and members have adapted to each other's working styles.
  - The team is in "autopilot" mode, where tasks are completed efficiently with minimal disruption.

#### **5. Adjourning Stage**

- **Description**: If the team has a specific project or deadline, this is the stage when the team completes its task and disbands.
- **Key Features**:
  - Members may feel **separation anxiety**, particularly if they have grown attached to the team.
  - If the team is behind on its goals, there may be a sense of crisis or panic.
  - Once the project is completed, members move on to new teams or projects, carrying with them the skills and experiences gained from the previous team.

### **3. Emotional and Behavioral Changes Across Team Stages**

- **Forming**: Members are excited, optimistic, and anxious about meeting new teammates.
- **Storming**: Reality sets in, leading to frustration, dissatisfaction, and anxiety. Conflicts arise as members adjust to each other.
- **Norming**: The team reaches consensus, understands their roles, and establishes **team cohesion**. Friendship ties and coping mechanisms emerge.
- **Performing**: The team achieves **synergy**, and performance peaks as members collaborate effectively. Minimal conflicts arise, and leadership plays a supportive role.
- **Adjourning**: As the team nears its end, members may experience separation anxiety and dissatisfaction if goals are unmet. However, they also look forward to new opportunities.

### **4. Impact of Virtual and Cross-Cultural Teams on Development**

- **Virtual Teams**: With the rise of virtual teams (teams working from different locations, often across countries), the dynamics of team development have shifted.
  - **Cross-cultural challenges**: Members from different cultures may face additional communication and collaboration barriers.
  - **Storming Stage in Virtual Teams**: This stage may either be more intense (due to cultural and communication gaps) or bypassed entirely if clear rules are set from the beginning.
  - **Adaptation**: Virtual teams may rely heavily on formalized rules, reducing the need for informal norming.

### **5. Problems in Teamwork**

#### **1. Free Riding**

- **Definition**: Free riding occurs when a team member does not contribute to the task but still benefits from the team's efforts.
- **Example**: A group member who doesn’t contribute to a project but claims ownership during presentations or final submissions.
- **Causes**:
  - **Diffusion of Responsibility**: Responsibility is spread among the group, so individuals feel less accountable.
  - **De-individualization**: In a group setting, it’s easier to avoid personal responsibility for failure or lack of effort.
  - **Sucker Aversion**: Some team members may avoid contributing to avoid being taken advantage of by others who rely on their hard work.

#### **2. Social Loafing**

- **Definition**: When individuals reduce their effort because they believe others in the team will compensate for their lack of contribution.
- **Opposite of Synergy**: In synergy, team members work better together, but in social loafing, individual efforts decrease when in a group.
- **Example**: In student projects, individuals who usually perform well on their own may reduce their effort when they believe others will carry the workload.

#### **Differences Between Free Riding and Social Loafing**:

- **Free Riding**: The individual consciously takes advantage of the team's effort and claims responsibility for the work.
- **Social Loafing**: The individual reduces effort unconsciously because they believe others will compensate.

---

### **6. Managing These Problems**

- **Leadership Role**: Leaders need to be vigilant about identifying free riding and social loafing early. They must create accountability mechanisms to ensure fair distribution of work.
- **Clear Roles and Responsibilities**: Defining roles and ensuring individuals understand their responsibilities can reduce diffusion of responsibility and de-individualization.

---

### **Summary**

- **Team Development**: Teams evolve through forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning stages. Each stage involves different levels of conflict, adaptation, and performance.
- **Problems in Teams**: Teams face unique challenges like free riding and social loafing. Both reduce individual accountability, but free riding involves deliberate exploitation of team efforts, while social loafing involves a subconscious reduction in effort.
