### **Organizational Culture (Part 1)**

---

### **1. Overview**

This chapter explores the concept of **organizational culture** and its impact on individuals and organizations. The main topics covered include:

- Definition of culture and its influence on individuals.
- Various levels of culture.
- **Organizational culture**: dimensions, creation, transmission, and expression.
- Types of cultures within organizations (e.g., strong, weak, dominant, subculture).
- Changing organizational culture.

### **2. Defining Culture**

Culture is a broad term discussed across various disciplines, including sociology, anthropology, and cultural studies. Each discipline defines culture in different ways based on the context. Here, we define culture as:

- **Ways of thinking, behaving, and believing** that members of a social unit share.
- It can be applied to a wide range of social units, such as regions, countries, or continents.
- **Cultural distinctions** exist between regions, but certain cultural elements are shared within a group.

**Example**:

- **Asians vs. Europeans**: Asians are often viewed as more **collectivistic**, meaning they consider others' opinions and consult elders before making decisions. Europeans, by contrast, are seen as more **individualistic**, emphasizing personal rights and freedoms.

### **3. Influence of Culture on Individuals**

- **Inherited Ideas, Beliefs, and Values**: Cultural values are passed down and help shape a group’s collective behavior. These values influence how individuals and groups respond to situations such as conflicts or challenges.
- **Culture and Norms**: Culture reflects a group's values, beliefs, and **norms** (unwritten rules), which are reinforced by group members. If someone deviates from these norms, the group encourages them to conform.

**Impact on Behavior**:

- **Conscious and Unconscious Influence**: Culture affects how individuals think, act, and behave at both the conscious and unconscious levels.

  - **Conscious**: Deciding how to greet someone (e.g., saying hello or bowing).
  - **Unconscious**: How close people stand to each other while talking, which varies by culture.
- **Value Systems and Attitudes**: Cultural values shape our personal values, attitudes, and perceptions. These values are learned through **socialization**, or interaction with others in society.

### **4. Levels of Culture**

Culture can exist at different levels, such as:

- **National or Regional Culture**: Shared cultural traits among people from a country or region.
- **Organizational Culture**: Culture specific to organizations, which we'll explore further.

### **5. Organizational Culture**

**Definition**:
Organizational culture is the **collective programming of the mind** that distinguishes the members of one organization from another. It reflects the unique history, values, and experiences of an organization.

**Key Points**:

- Every organization is a **social unit** with its own distinct culture, shaped by its history and experiences.
- **Organizational culture** impacts how the organization handles challenges, crises, and opportunities.
- Employees share and **imbibe organizational culture**, which influences their behavior and decision-making.

**Example**:

- The way employees at Tata handle problems may differ from employees at Infosys, as both organizations have distinct cultures.

### **6. Professionalization and Cultural Layers**

- **Professionalization**: Each profession (e.g., doctors, academics) has its own set of values that members share, regardless of their organization or nationality. These professional values often overlap or conflict with **national culture** and **organizational culture**.
- **Cultural Dynamics**: Individuals constantly balance demands from multiple cultural layers, such as **national culture**, **organizational culture**, and **professional culture**.

---

### **7. Organizational Culture as Personality**

- Just as **personality** defines an individual’s behavior, **organizational culture** defines an organization's behavior in various situations (e.g., market challenges, crises).
- Organizational culture is often **shared** among employees, though it may be difficult to explicitly define. Employees may not articulate it, but it becomes evident through their actions.

### **8. Sector-Wise Organizational Culture**

**Industry-Wise Similarities**:

- Organizational culture can also vary across **industries**. For example, organizations within the same industry (e.g., IT, education, healthcare) may share similar cultural traits due to common driving forces within the sector.

**Examples**:

1. **Telecom Sector**: Known for its high competitiveness, which becomes part of the DNA of organizations within the sector.
2. **Education Sector**: Considered more **calm** and **long-term** oriented compared to other sectors.
3. **Bureaucracy (Government Sector)**: Focuses on maintaining control and creating order.
4. **Family-Owned Businesses**: Often **dependency-oriented**, fostering close, hierarchical relationships among employees.
5. **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)**: Typically focused on outreach and helping others, less competitive compared to other sectors.

### **Conclusion**

This section of the chapter introduces the concept of culture, emphasizing how it influences both individuals and organizations. The specific concept of **organizational culture** reflects the personality of the organization, shaping employee behavior and organizational outcomes. Furthermore, **cultural dynamics** exist not only at the national or regional level but also within professions and industries, creating a complex interplay of cultural influences.
