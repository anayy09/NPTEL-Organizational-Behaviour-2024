### **1. Defining Groups**

A **group** is defined as any number of people who:

- **Share common goals**.
- **Communicate** with each other over time.
- Are small enough to allow **person-to-person interaction**.

**Why Do People Form Groups?**

- **Task Accomplishment**: Groups come together to complete a specific goal or project.
- **Security**: People feel safer or more secure in groups.
- **Affiliation**: Social needs are fulfilled through group membership and interactions.

---

### **2. Defining Teams**

A **team** is a specialized type of group characterized by:

- **Interdependency**: Members work together, depending on one another to achieve a common goal.
- **Cooperation**: Collaboration between members is a key element of a team.
- **Shared Responsibility**: Teams share collective responsibility for outcomes, particularly in organizational settings.

**Work Teams**: These are interdependent groups of individuals who work together for specific outcomes within an organization.

---

### **3. Differences Between Teams and Groups**

- **Teams** are structured groups that operate primarily in **work contexts**, while **groups** can exist in various contexts.
- Teams have:
  - **More accountability** than groups.
  - **Higher levels of synergy** (the combined effort of the team exceeds the sum of individual contributions).
  - A **limited size** (generally smaller than groups).
  - **Specialized roles** based on knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs).

---

### **4. Types of Teams**

Teams can be categorized based on their functions and structure:

1. **Production Teams**: Typically semi-autonomous, often led by a supervisor. Members focus on completing tasks in production environments (e.g., assembly lines).
2. **Service Teams**: Teams like airline crews, maintenance groups, and customer service teams, which focus on delivering services.
3. **Management Teams**: Involved in management and decision-making functions within organizations.
4. **Project Teams**: Usually cross-functional, meaning members come from different departments to work on specific projects. They often have a **deadline**.
5. **Action and Performing Teams**: High-performing teams in time-sensitive tasks, like orchestras or tactical teams in military operations.
6. **Advisory Teams**: Teams of experts that provide guidance, often with lower interdependence between members.
7. **Self-Managing Teams**: Teams where members have **complete freedom** in determining roles, goals, and task assignments. These teams are more common in creative or innovative organizations.

---

### **5. Group Development Perspective (Tuckman & Jensen Model)**

This model describes how groups develop over time:

1. **Forming**:

   - **Orientation**: Members get to know each other and understand their roles.
2. **Storming**:

   - **Conflict**: Differences in expectations, goals, or roles create tension.
3. **Norming**:

   - **Establishment of Rules**: Unwritten rules and social relationships develop, helping the group function smoothly.
4. **Performing**:

   - **Focus on Work**: The team efficiently works toward completing tasks.
5. **Adjourning**:

   - **Dissolution**: Once the task is completed, the group disbands.

---

### **6. Problems in Teamwork**

#### **6.1 Free Riding and Social Loafing**

These two behaviors often reduce team effectiveness:

- **Free Riding**:

  - Occurs when an individual takes advantage of the group's effort without contributing.
  - **Reasons**:
    - **Diffusion of Responsibility**: Individuals feel less personal responsibility when working in a group.
    - **Deindividuation**: The individual's identity and accountability are reduced in the group context.
    - **Sucker Aversion**: People may avoid taking initiative for fear of being overburdened with tasks.
- **Social Loafing**:

  - The tendency of individuals to **reduce effort** when working in a group because their contributions are less noticeable.
  - **Conditions That Increase Social Loafing**:
    1. **Large Team Size**: Larger teams dilute individual responsibility.
    2. **Perceived Low Instrumentality**: Members may feel their efforts won’t make a significant difference.
    3. **Low Trust**: If team members don’t trust each other, effort decreases.
    4. **Mundane Tasks**: Uninteresting or repetitive tasks can reduce motivation.
    5. **Presence of an “Eager Beaver”**: If one member takes on most of the responsibility, others may slack off.
    6. **Cultural Factors**: Different cultures may have varying expectations of team involvement.

**Tackling Social Loafing**:

- **Increase Identifiability**: Regular evaluations (e.g., weekly reporting) can ensure accountability.
- **Promote Involvement**: Make tasks interesting and foster pride in membership.
- **Reward Team Members**: **Symbolic rewards** (e.g., recognition) are more effective than monetary rewards, which can lead to competition.
- **Strengthen Cohesion**: Build trust and cooperation among team members.
- **Set Individual Goals**: Align personal goals with team objectives to enhance ownership.
- **Use Team Contracts**: Members can set goals and deadlines in agreement with each other to ensure commitment.
- **Internal Feedback Reviews**: Regular team meetings to discuss progress and challenges.

#### **6.2 Groupthink**

**Groupthink** occurs when the desire for harmony or consensus in a group leads to poor decision-making. Members avoid conflict or dissent, resulting in irrational or dysfunctional outcomes.

**Characteristics of Groupthink**:

1. **Illusion of Invulnerability**: The group believes it is invincible and immune to failure.
2. **Collective Rationalization**: Members justify decisions, ignoring contrary evidence.
3. **Unquestioned Belief**: The group holds an unquestioned belief in its moral correctness.
4. **Stereotypical Views**: The group develops biased, often negative views of outsiders.
5. **Direct Pressure**: Pressure is applied to dissenters to conform.
6. **Self-Censorship**: Members withhold their opinions to avoid conflict.
7. **Illusion of Unanimity**: Silence is interpreted as agreement, leading to a false sense of consensus.

**Remedies for Groupthink**:

1. **Organizational Remedies**:

   - Use **external auditors** to evaluate decisions.
   - Assign multiple groups to examine the same issue.
   - Train teams to recognize and avoid groupthink.
2. **Leader-Oriented Remedies**:

   - Encourage **critical thinking** by not immediately imposing personal opinions.
   - Involve **outsiders** in the decision-making process.
   - Assign a **devil’s advocate** role to challenge ideas and ensure thorough discussion.
3. **Member-Oriented Remedies**:

   - Encourage members to evaluate all ideas critically before making decisions.
   - Share ideas with **external experts** for objective feedback.
4. **Process-Oriented Remedies**:

   - Use **subgroups** to develop alternative solutions to problems.
   - Hold **second chance meetings** after decisions are made to re-evaluate choices without time pressure.

### **Conclusion**

This chapter covered the essential elements of group dynamics, including the formation, development, and challenges faced by teams. The **Tuckman & Jensen model** provides a useful framework for understanding how teams evolve, while addressing problems like **free riding**, **social loafing**, and **groupthink** is crucial for improving team effectiveness. Teams that manage these dynamics well can maximize performance and achieve their goals efficiently.

### **Organizational Culture**

---

### **1. Definition of Culture**

Culture refers to the **ways of thinking, behaving, and believing** that are shared among members of a social unit. It encompasses:

- **Inherited ideas, beliefs, and values** that guide social actions.
- The total range of activities and ideas within a group, reinforced and transmitted by its members.

In the context of **organizational culture**, it refers to the **shared meaning** and beliefs within an organization that shape how employees behave and make decisions. It serves as the organization's "personality."

---

### **2. Impact of Culture on Individuals**

- **Conscious and Unconscious Influence**: Culture affects individuals both consciously (e.g., greetings, gestures) and unconsciously (e.g., physical distance in conversations).
- **Value System**: Culture influences how individuals perceive things, what they value, and how they interpret the world.
- **Learned and Reinforced**: Culture is learned through socialization and reinforced by the behaviors and norms of others.

---

### **3. Levels of Culture**

- **National/Regional Culture**: Broad cultural values shared within countries or regions.
- **Organizational Culture**: The unique culture within an organization that distinguishes it from others.
- **Professionalization**: Cultural values tied to specific professions, such as those learned through training (e.g., medical or academic professions).

---

### **4. Organizational Culture**

- **Personality of the Organization**: Organizational culture is akin to the "personality" of the organization, dictating how it responds to challenges, crises, and change.
- **Shared Meaning**: It is a **system of shared meaning** that influences how employees behave within the organization.
- **Perception and Shared Understanding**: Employees may not always articulate organizational culture but share and internalize it through behaviors and decision-making.

---

### **5. Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions**

Geert Hofstede identified **five key dimensions** to describe cultural values in organizations:

1. **Power Distance**:

   - Refers to how power is distributed and the degree of **inequality** in decision-making authority.
   - In **high power distance** cultures, hierarchies are strict, and people with power are respected or feared. In **low power distance** cultures, power is more equally distributed.
2. **Uncertainty Avoidance**:

   - Measures how comfortable an organization is with **ambiguity and uncertainty**.
   - **High uncertainty avoidance** organizations prefer clear rules and structures to minimize unpredictability. **Low uncertainty avoidance** organizations tolerate ambiguity and encourage innovation.
3. **Individualism vs. Collectivism**:

   - **Individualism** emphasizes personal goals and individual rights, often leading to competition and personal rewards.
   - **Collectivism** prioritizes group welfare, encouraging teamwork and collaboration over individual achievement.
4. **Masculinity vs. Femininity**:

   - **Masculinity** values strength, competition, and achievement.
   - **Femininity** values nurturing, cooperation, and concern for quality of life.
5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation**:

   - **Long-term orientation** focuses on sustained efforts and long-term success, valuing loyalty and stability.
   - **Short-term orientation** emphasizes immediate results and quick gains, often prioritizing short-term profits over long-term sustainability.

---

### **6. Dimensions of Organizational Culture**

In addition to Hofstede’s framework, organizations can be described using the following dimensions:

- **Attention to Detail**: Similar to uncertainty avoidance, focusing on precision and detail.
- **Outcome Orientation**: Focus on results and achievement (related to masculinity).
- **People Orientation**: Emphasis on employee well-being and team orientation (related to collectivism and femininity).
- **Team Orientation**: Encouragement of teamwork and collaboration.
- **Aggressiveness**: Linked to a competitive, achievement-driven culture (masculinity).
- **Stability**: Emphasis on long-term sustainability (linked to long-term orientation).
- **Innovation and Risk-Taking**: Organizations low in uncertainty avoidance encourage risk-taking and innovation.

---

### **7. Strong vs. Weak Organizational Cultures**

- **Strong Cultures**:

  - **Widely Shared Values**: Strong cultures are characterized by a high level of agreement on core values among employees.
  - **Influence on Managers**: Managers are strongly influenced by the organization’s culture and are expected to uphold and reinforce its values.
  - **Resistance to Change**: Strong cultures are often resistant to change and may suppress creativity.
- **Weak Cultures**:

  - Employees may not share the same values or exhibit similar behaviors, leading to less cohesion and uniformity.

---

### **8. Dominant Culture vs. Subculture**

- **Dominant Culture**: The core values shared by the majority of the organization’s members.
- **Subcultures**: Smaller cultures within the organization, often reflecting the unique challenges faced by specific departments or groups. These subcultures may form horizontally (e.g., departments) or vertically (e.g., different levels of management).
  - A **balance** between dominant and subcultures is crucial for maintaining organizational cohesion.

---

### **9. Creation, Sustaining, and Transmitting Organizational Culture**

**Creation**:

- **Founders’ Vision**: The culture often originates from the values and vision of the organization's founders.

**Sustaining**:

1. **Recruitment**: Organizations hire individuals who fit the existing culture, perpetuating cultural values over time.
2. **Management Actions**: Leaders reinforce cultural values through their behaviors and the behaviors they reward.
3. **Socialization**: New employees learn the culture through observation and interaction with existing employees.

**Transmission**:

- **Common Expressions**: Organizational culture is communicated and reinforced through symbols, language, stories, rituals, ceremonies, and behavioral norms.

---

### **10. Expressions of Organizational Culture**

- **Physical Artifacts**: Office layout, décor, and facilities (e.g., shared vs. private offices) reflect cultural values.
- **Language and Jargon**: Specialized terminology or gender-neutral job titles (e.g., "chairperson") demonstrate organizational values.
- **Stories and Myths**: Legends about founders or leaders that reflect the organization’s values (e.g., CEOs who send personal birthday wishes).
- **Rituals and Ceremonies**: Celebrations, staff meetings, and appraisal processes that reinforce values.
- **Behavioral Norms**: Rules about interactions with colleagues and superiors, dress codes, and how meetings are conducted.
- **Shared Beliefs and Values**: Ethical codes or moral standards that guide behavior and decision-making.
- **Basic Assumptions**: Unconscious beliefs that form the core of organizational culture.

---

### **11. Managing (Changing) Organizational Culture**

**When to Change**:

- **Adaptation**: Culture must adapt to changing environments or external pressures, such as market demands or technological advancements.
- **Challenges of Change**: Employees may resist change due to deep-rooted cultural values, making it difficult to unlearn long-held beliefs.

**Factors Leading to Cultural Change**:

1. **Crisis**: A significant downturn or crisis may necessitate a change in culture.
2. **Leadership Turnover**: New leaders bring new values and priorities.
3. **Organizational Life Cycle**: As organizations grow or evolve, their cultural values may need to change.
4. **Size**: Larger organizations may experience the rise of subcultures that challenge or alter the dominant culture.
5. **Strength of Current Culture**: Strong cultures are more resistant to change, while weak cultures may be easier to modify.
6. **Absence of Subcultures**: A lack of subcultures can make cultural change easier, as there is less internal resistance.

---

### **Conclusion**

Organizational culture is a dynamic and influential force that shapes behaviors, decisions, and organizational outcomes. By understanding the dimensions of culture and how it manifests, organizations can navigate internal challenges, adapt to external changes, and ensure long-term success. Changing organizational culture is difficult but necessary when environmental conditions shift or internal needs require transformation.
