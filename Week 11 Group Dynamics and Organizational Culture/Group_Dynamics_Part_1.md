### **1. What is a Group?**

A **group** is defined as a **collection of individuals who come together to share common goals** and communicate over time. The group size is typically smaller compared to organizations, allowing for **personal communication**.

- **Key Elements of a Group**:
  1. **Size**:
     - Small enough to enable personal communication.
     - Ideal size: 6â€“8 people (max. 10-15).
     - Smallest group: 3 members (below which it becomes a "diad").
     - If the group exceeds 12 members, **subgroup formation** may occur, affecting dynamics.
  2. **Shared Goals**:
     - **Common Goal**: All members work together toward one shared objective.
     - **Interdependent Goals**: Each member has individual goals, but they are mutually dependent (overlapping) to achieve success.
  3. **Interdependency**:
     - Members depend on one another to fulfill their roles and goals.

**Why Do People Form Groups?**

1. **Task Accomplishment**: Groups are often formed to complete specific tasks or solve problems.
2. **Security**: Being part of a group offers individuals a sense of safety, especially in unfamiliar environments.
3. **Affiliation**: Humans have a natural need for social interaction, identification with others, and feeling accepted. Groups fulfill this psychological need for belonging.

### **2. Differences Between Groups and Teams**

The terms **"group"** and **"team"** are often used interchangeably, but there are notable differences. A **team** is a more cohesive and structured form of a group, with members cooperating toward a specific goal.

- **Key Differences**:
  1. **Cooperation**:
     - Teams actively help each other (cooperation), while groups may not require cooperation.
  2. **Cohesiveness**:
     - Teams are more cohesive, with stronger internal bonds and clearer boundaries between members and outsiders.
  3. **Interdependency**:
     - Teams have a higher degree of interdependency compared to groups.
  4. **Structure**:
     - Teams are formal and structured. Roles are well-defined, and there is often a hierarchy (team leader, etc.).
     - Groups are less formal and may not have clearly assigned roles or hierarchy.
  5. **Synergy**:
     - Teams exhibit **synergy**, meaning the collective result is greater than the sum of individual efforts.

In summary, **teams are smaller, more structured, and purpose-driven groups**, often found in work contexts, with a focus on accountability and cooperation.

### **3. Types of Teams**

Teams within organizations can vary widely based on their goals, structure, and interdependencies.

1. **Production Teams**:

   - Example: Assembly line teams with a supervisor.
   - Members have little decision-making freedom.
2. **Service Teams**:

   - Example: Airline crews, customer service, and sales teams.
   - Focused on customer-facing roles.
3. **Management Teams**:

   - Example: Middle-level managers who form teams to make strategic decisions.
   - Often found at higher levels of organizational hierarchy.
4. **Project Teams**:

   - **Cross-functional**: Members from different departments work together.
   - **Temporary**: Formed to complete a specific project within a deadline.
5. **Action/Performance Teams**:

   - Example: Orchestra, tactical army units.
   - **Short-term** and often **temporary**, formed for specific actions or performances.
6. **Advisory Teams**:

   - Composed of experts providing guidance.
   - Typically have lower interdependence among members.
7. **Self-managing Teams**:

   - Highly autonomous, with members responsible for selecting goals, assigning roles, and managing themselves.
   - Common in creative and mature organizations where members have extensive expertise.

**Key Features of Different Teams**:

- **Boundedness**: How closely members are tied to the team (e.g., high in self-managing teams, low in project teams).
- **Interdependency**: The level of reliance on each other (high in self-managing and project teams, low in advisory teams).

### **4. Group Development Over Time**

Teams evolve over time through **stages of group development**:

1. **Forming**: Group comes together.
2. **Storming**: Members express different views and conflict arises.
3. **Norming**: Norms, roles, and cooperation develop.
4. **Performing**: Group works productively towards goals.
5. **Adjourning**: The group disbands after task completion.

### **5. Problems in Group Dynamics**

1. **Free Riding/Social Loafing**:

   - When certain group members contribute less because they rely on others to carry the workload.
2. **Groupthink**:

   - A phenomenon where the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in poor decision-making, as dissenting opinions are suppressed.

---

### **Summary**

- Groups and teams are integral in organizational settings. While they share similarities, teams are more structured, cohesive, and work interdependently toward a specific goal. Various types of teams exist, from production and service teams to self-managing and advisory teams, each with unique characteristics and degrees of freedom. Teams also evolve through developmental stages and face common problems such as free-riding and groupthink. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for managing work in flat organizational structures where group collaboration is essential.
