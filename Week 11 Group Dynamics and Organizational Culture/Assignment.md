### 1. A type of thought exhibited by group members who try to minimize conflict and reach consensus without critically testing, analyzing, and evaluating ideas.

**Answer: Groupthink**
**Reference**: In Lecture 3 of *Group Dynamics*, it was explained that **groupthink** occurs when members prioritize consensus over critical evaluation to avoid conflict. This often leads to poor decision-making as critical voices are suppressed. (Lecture 3, Group Dynamics)

### 3. Groups are more cohesive than teams, and groups are a subset of teams.

**Answer: False**
**Reference**: In Lecture 1 of *Group Dynamics*, it was clarified that **teams** are generally more cohesive and structured than groups, and teams are actually a **subset of groups**, not the other way around.

### 7. Sometimes in teams, people may think that if they work more, other people will take advantage of them and give all the responsibilities to them. So it is better to decrease their performance. This phenomenon is called:

**Answer: Sucker aversion**
**Reference**: In Lecture 3 of *Group Dynamics*, **sucker aversion** refers to the reluctance of team members to exert maximum effort, fearing they will be exploited if others rely on them to do all the work. This leads to a decrease in performance to avoid becoming the "sucker." (Lecture 3, Group Dynamics)

---

### 8. Low trust among the team members can often lead to social loafing.

**Answer: True**
**Reference**: In Lecture 3 of *Group Dynamics*, **low trust** was identified as a factor that contributes to **social loafing**, where team members reduce their effort because they believe their contributions won’t be acknowledged or trusted. (Lecture 3, Group Dynamics)

---

### 9. Culture influences both the conscious and unconscious level of the mind.

**Reference**: In Lecture 1 of *Organizational Culture*, it was stated that **culture influences behavior at both the conscious and unconscious levels**.
