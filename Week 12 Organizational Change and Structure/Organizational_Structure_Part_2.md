### Week 12 Lecture 3: Organizational Structure (Part 2)

#### 1. **Recap of Organizational Structure and Dimensions**

- **Organizational Structure** defines how tasks, authority, and resources are distributed in an organization to achieve its goals.
- Key **dimensions**:
  1. **Complexity** (discussed in Lecture 2): Refers to the differentiation of an organization into vertical, horizontal, or spatial units.
  2. **Formalization**: The focus of this lecture.
  3. **Centralization**: To be discussed in this lecture.

#### 2. **Formalization**

- **Definition**: Formalization refers to the extent to which **rules, policies, procedures**, and **job descriptions** are explicitly written and enforced in an organization. It standardizes jobs by specifying what tasks must be done and how they are to be completed.
- **Key Elements**:

  1. **Policies**: General guidelines that help employees approach specific situations.
  2. **Procedures**: Detailed steps outlining how tasks are to be carried out (e.g., applying for leave).
  3. **Rules**: Explicit directives about what is allowed and what is not, often outlining exceptions or special cases.
  4. **Job Descriptions**: Specify the responsibilities, tasks, and authority level of each employee.
  5. **Process Documents**: Detailed manuals that outline how specific processes are to be executed.
- **Importance of Formalization**:

  - High formalization reduces **individual discretion** by clearly prescribing what employees can and cannot do.
  - Standardized jobs ensure **predictability** in task completion but can limit flexibility and creativity.
- **Types of Formalization**:

  - **Explicit Formalization**: Written rules and procedures that are clearly outlined.
  - **Implicit Formalization**: Unwritten norms that guide behavior, forming part of the organizational culture. For example, while an employee may be entitled to take 10 days of leave, the organization's **culture** may discourage frequent leave-taking unless necessary.
- **Varied Levels of Formalization**:

  - **Between organizations**: Some organizations have highly formalized structures with strict rules, while others provide more flexibility.
  - **Within organizations**: Formalization may differ by department. For example:
    - **Marketing and sales**: Require flexibility and thus have fewer rules.
    - **Production and quality control**: Require precision, leading to higher levels of formalization.
- **Impact of Professionalism**:

  - Employees with **professional training** (e.g., doctors, engineers, professors) may not need strict rules due to their self-discipline and professional ethics. These employees are often given more freedom due to their **internalized standards** of conduct.
- **Techniques for Formalization**:

  1. **Selection**: Organizations select employees who align with their values and culture, especially for middle and senior positions.
  2. **Role Requirements**: Clearly communicating the responsibilities and expectations of the job to employees.
  3. **Training and Induction**: Training new hires on organizational values, rules, and procedures.
  4. **Rituals**: Symbolic events (e.g., Founder's Day, "Bring Your Family to Work Day") help reinforce the organizationâ€™s values and culture.

#### 3. **Centralization**

- **Definition**: Centralization refers to the degree to which **decision-making authority** is concentrated at a single point in the organization, such as in a single individual, unit, or level (e.g., top management).
- **Highly Centralized Organizations**: Decision-making is concentrated at the top, with limited delegation of authority to lower levels.
- **Factors Influencing Centralization**:

  1. **Size of the Organization**: Larger organizations tend to decentralize decision-making to subunits to avoid bottlenecks at the top. However, some key decisions may still be centralized.
  2. **Geographical Dispersion**: Organizations operating across multiple regions or countries often decentralize to allow local units to adapt to unique conditions while maintaining core values centrally.
  3. **Technology Complexity**: Complex technologies might require either centralization (to control key technological decisions) or decentralization (if expertise is spread across different levels).
  4. **Environmental Uncertainty**: In uncertain environments, decentralization allows people closer to the situation (e.g., those interacting with customers) to make timely decisions.
- **Arguments for Decentralization**:

  1. **Reduces Information Overload**: Decentralizing decision-making reduces the burden on top management to process vast amounts of information.
  2. **Speedy Action**: Decentralization enables faster decisions as employees at lower levels can respond to local situations immediately.
  3. **Improves Input Quality**: Lower-level managers are closer to day-to-day operations and have a better understanding of the ground reality, enabling more informed decisions.
  4. **Motivates Employees**: Delegating authority boosts employee motivation by making them feel empowered and trusted.
  5. **Training Opportunity**: Decentralization provides lower-level managers with the experience of decision-making, preparing them for future leadership roles.
- **Arguments for Centralization**:

  1. **Alignment with Organizational Goals**: Centralization ensures decisions reflect the overall goals of the organization rather than the interests of subunits.
  2. **Core Decisions**: Certain crucial decisions, especially those tied to the organization's **core values**, are better made centrally.
  3. **Use of IT Systems**: Advanced information systems (e.g., decision-making support systems) can enable efficient centralized decision-making by providing top leaders with relevant data.
- **Balancing Centralization and Decentralization**:

  - Organizations must adapt their level of centralization based on changing circumstances. For example, in times of stability, centralization might work, but in periods of rapid change or uncertainty, decentralization might be more effective.
