### Week 12 Lecture 2: Organizational Structure (Part 1)

#### 1. **Introduction to Organizational Structure**

- **Definition**: Organizational structure is the formal system through which **tasks and authority** are allocated within an organization. It defines how work is divided, how authority is distributed, and how employees interact to achieve organizational goals.
- **Key Functions**:

  - **Task Allocation**: Clarifies who does what within the organization.
  - **Authority Relationships**: Defines the hierarchy, decision-making power, and who reports to whom.
  - **Coordination and Interaction**: Specifies how employees communicate and collaborate, ensuring the efficient use of resources.
- The structure is critical for **employee behavior** as it influences coordination, control, and communication within the organization.

#### 2. **Components and Dimensions of Organizational Structure**

   The lecture outlines three primary dimensions of organizational structure:

1. **Complexity**: Refers to the degree of differentiation within an organization. It includes horizontal, vertical, and spatial differentiation, which increases the complexity of management.
2. **Formalization**: The extent to which tasks and behaviors are regulated by written rules and policies.
3. **Centralization**: The level at which decision-making power is concentrated within the organization.

#### 3. **Key Dimensions of Organizational Structure**

- **Complexity**:

  - **Horizontal Differentiation**: Refers to the grouping of employees based on their functional areas (e.g., departments like finance, marketing). It is influenced by factors such as employee orientation (background, education) or the type of work they perform.
  - **Vertical Differentiation**: Denotes the levels of hierarchy within the organization. A deeper vertical structure means more layers of authority, which can slow down communication and decision-making.
  - **Spatial Differentiation**: The geographical dispersion of the organization’s units, such as regional offices or international branches. More spatial differentiation increases complexity and the need for coordination.
- **Formalization**:

  - The extent to which roles, rules, and procedures are explicitly written and enforced within the organization. High formalization ensures uniformity but can also reduce flexibility.
- **Centralization**:

  - The degree to which decision-making authority is concentrated at the top levels of the organization. Highly centralized organizations keep decision-making power with senior leaders, whereas decentralized structures distribute authority across levels.

#### 4. **Administrative Component of Organizational Structure**

- **Line vs. Staff Personnel**:
  - **Line Managers**: Those directly involved in the organization’s core functions (e.g., production in a manufacturing firm).
  - **Staff Managers**: Support the line managers by handling non-core functions like HR, finance, or logistics.
- **Balancing Line and Staff**: An imbalance between line and staff personnel can affect organizational efficiency. Too few staff may overwhelm line managers with administrative tasks, while too many staff can drain resources without directly contributing to value creation.

#### 5. **Autonomy and Delegation in Organizational Structure**

- **Autonomy**: The degree of **freedom** employees have to make decisions without seeking approval from higher-ups.
- **Delegation**: The extent to which decision-making power is passed down to lower levels. It contrasts with **centralization**, where decision-making is concentrated at the top.
- A **balance** between centralization and decentralization depends on the organization’s needs and the nature of its operations.

#### 6. **Methods of Coordination in Complex Organizations**

   Managing complexity requires mechanisms to ensure cooperation and communication across departments and levels. Some methods include:

- **Horizontal Coordination**:

  1. **Using Common Resources**: Shared resources, such as cafeterias or libraries, encourage employees from different departments to interact informally, fostering collaboration.
  2. **Information Systems**: Automated systems (e.g., databases, online platforms) allow information to be shared across departments, preventing duplication of efforts and ensuring access to critical data.
  3. **Lateral Relationships**: Individuals or liaisons within each department help coordinate activities and share information across departments. These relationships ensure smooth communication and collaboration.
  4. **Task Forces and Teams**: Interdisciplinary teams, or task forces, consist of members from different departments working together on specific projects, facilitating knowledge sharing and collective problem-solving.
- **Vertical Coordination**:

  1. **Formalization**: By establishing clear rules and guidelines, lower-level employees can make decisions without needing frequent approval from higher-ups.
  2. **Span of Control**: Refers to how many subordinates a manager supervises. A wider span of control leads to a **flatter organizational structure**, while a narrower span results in a **taller hierarchy** with more levels.
  3. **Centralization vs. Delegation**: In centralized structures, decision-making authority is concentrated at the top, while in decentralized systems, decision-making power is delegated across different levels. Both approaches have advantages depending on the situation.
  4. **Support Staff**: Support functions (e.g., HR, administrative roles) assist line managers by handling non-core tasks, allowing line managers to focus on their primary responsibilities.

#### 7. **Horizontal and Vertical Differentiation**

- **Horizontal Differentiation**: Defines how people are grouped into departments based on function, customer type, or task. Each department has its own distinct identity and possibly a **subculture**, which can challenge larger organizational goals.
- **Vertical Differentiation**: Refers to the number of levels in the hierarchy. The number of levels is influenced by the **span of control**—how many employees report to a single manager. The smaller the span, the taller the hierarchy, and vice versa.

#### 8. **Managing Complexity through Coordination**

- **Importance of Synergy**: Managers must ensure that departments and levels within the organization cooperate and do not lose sight of the overall organizational goals. Synergy is harder to maintain as complexity increases, especially with many departments or hierarchical layers.
- **Managerial Role**: Managers play a key role in facilitating **horizontal and vertical coordination**, ensuring smooth communication, resource sharing, and cooperation between departments and across levels.
