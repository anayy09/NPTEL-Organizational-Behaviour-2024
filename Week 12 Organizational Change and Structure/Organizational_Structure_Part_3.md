### Week 12 Lecture 4: Organizational Structure (Part 3)

#### 1. **Recap of Organizational Structure Dimensions**

- **Complexity**: Differentiation into horizontal, vertical, and spatial subgroups. Each level of complexity requires different mechanisms for **coordination**.
- **Formalization**: The extent to which **rules, policies, and procedures** are written down and enforced. It ensures predictability but can limit flexibility.
- **Centralization**: Refers to how **decision-making power** is concentrated in one individual, unit, or level. Centralization has its **advantages** (e.g., consistent decision-making) and **disadvantages** (e.g., slower response times).

#### 2. **Importance of Perspectives on Organizational Structure**

- Understanding the nature of organizations is crucial to predict and interpret **human behavior** within them. The conceptualization of an organization shapes how we develop theories to explain behavior in the workplace.
- Two important perspectives that aid in understanding organizational behavior are:
  1. **Systems Perspective**
  2. **Life Cycle Perspective**

#### 3. **Systems Perspective**

- **Definition**: Organizations are viewed as **systems**—collections of interrelated and interdependent parts that function together to achieve a unified whole.
- **System Components**:

  - **Subsystems**: Each organization consists of various subsystems (e.g., departments, units), and each subsystem is also part of larger systems (e.g., society, economy).
  - **Interdependency**: Subsystems **influence** and **depend** on each other. For example, the marketing department depends on production, while both depend on HR for staffing.
  - **Input-Process-Output**: Systems take inputs, process them, and produce outputs. In organizations, inputs include resources (e.g., labor, capital), processes include organizational activities, and outputs include products or services.
- **Key Concepts in Systems Theory**:

  - **Subsystem Interactions**: Different subsystems (e.g., departments) **cooperate** and **compete** for resources. Effective cooperation maintains organizational balance, while competition can lead to conflicts.
  - **Conflict vs. Cooperation**: The challenge is to balance the **need for cooperation** (to achieve shared goals) with **healthy competition** (to allocate resources and maintain subsystem identity).
  - **Differentiation vs. Integration**: Subsystems assert their identity (differentiation), while also needing to align with the **larger organizational goals** (integration).
- **Closed vs. Open Systems**:

  - **Closed Systems**: Isolated from external influences, focused on internal stability. However, this can make the system vulnerable to external changes.
  - **Open Systems**: Engage with the external environment, allowing adaptation to external changes (e.g., market shifts or technological advances). Too much openness can dilute the organization’s identity, while too little openness risks stagnation.
  - **Boundary Spanning**: Certain roles (e.g., sales, marketing) act as boundary spanners, linking the organization with its external environment. They gather and relay external information, helping the organization adapt to changes.

#### 4. **Life Cycle Perspective**

- **Definition**: The life cycle perspective sees organizations as **organisms** that go through distinct stages of development, much like biological entities (birth, growth, maturity, and decline).
- **Four Stages of Organizational Life Cycle**:

  1. **Entrepreneurial Stage**:

     - The organization is in its **startup** phase, with few employees and a high level of **uncertainty**.
     - Leadership is **informal**, and there is a focus on **creativity** and risk-taking, driven by the passion of the founder or entrepreneur.
     - High failure rates occur at this stage, often due to lack of resources or market traction (known as "liability of newness").
  2. **Collectivity Stage**:

     - The organization begins to **grow**, and there is increased **clarity** in goals and direction.
     - A more **formalized structure** starts to emerge, but communication and decision-making may still be **informal**.
     - Employees are often highly committed as the organization builds momentum, though there is pressure to **benchmark** against more established organizations (isomorphism).
  3. **Formalization and Control Stage**:

     - The organization becomes **mature**, with established **rules** and **procedures**. Innovation decreases as stability and predictability become priorities.
     - Decision-making becomes **conservative** and role clarity is high. The founder’s influence diminishes as the organization’s structure solidifies.
     - The organization exists beyond the influence of the **individual founder**, and the founder’s role becomes more **symbolic**.
  4. **Elaboration of Structure Stage**:

     - The organization begins to **diversify** into new product lines or markets. This growth increases **complexity**.
     - To manage the growing complexity, the organization may **decentralize**, with each product line or division becoming a semi-independent entity.
     - **Diversification** drives the need for **strategic growth**, either through acquiring related businesses or expanding into complementary sectors.
- **Decline Stage**:

  - After a period of growth, the organization may face **decline** due to external competition, internal conflicts, or inability to adapt to new technologies.
  - **Complacency** can set in, making the organization slow to react to external changes.
  - To reverse decline, organizations may undergo a **turnaround** by bringing in new leadership, reorganizing their structure, and adopting an **entrepreneurial mindset** again. If turnaround efforts fail, the organization may cease to exist.

#### 5. **Implications of the Life Cycle Perspective**

- Each stage of the organizational life cycle presents **different challenges** and **opportunities** for leadership, culture, and employee behavior.
- Understanding the organization’s life cycle helps identify the appropriate **strategies** and **management styles** needed for success at each stage.
