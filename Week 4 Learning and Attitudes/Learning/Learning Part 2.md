### Chapter 4: Learning (Part 2)

#### **1. Recap of Previous Lecture**

* **Definition of Learning** :
* Learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior resulting from experience.
* **Key Theories** :
* **Classical Conditioning** : A neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus, eventually leading the neutral stimulus to elicit the same response as the unconditioned stimulus.
  * Example: Pavlovâ€™s dog experiment where the bell (neutral stimulus) paired with food (unconditioned stimulus) eventually caused the dog to salivate at the sound of the bell alone.
* **Operant Conditioning** : Behavior is shaped by its consequences, such as rewards (positive reinforcement) or the removal of negative stimuli (negative reinforcement).
  *  **Reinforcement** : Strengthens behavior, with positive reinforcement involving a reward and negative reinforcement involving the removal of an unpleasant stimulus.
  *  **Punishment** : Introduces an aversive consequence to reduce undesired behavior.
  *  **Extinction** : When the reinforcement or punishment is no longer present, the conditioned behavior may gradually diminish.

#### **2. Detailed Discussion on Reinforcement and Punishment**

* **Partial Reinforcement** :
* **Concept** : After conditioning, behavior can be maintained without constant reinforcement.
* **Types of Partial Reinforcement** :
  *  **Fixed Interval Schedule** : Reinforcement is provided after a fixed period (e.g., annual performance reviews). Often leads to increased behavior as the reinforcement time approaches.
  *  **Variable Interval Schedule** : Reinforcement is given at unpredictable intervals (e.g., surprise quizzes), leading to more consistent behavior.
  *  **Fixed Ratio Schedule** : Reinforcement occurs after a set number of behaviors (e.g., a bonus after every 10 sales).
  *  **Variable Ratio Schedule** : Reinforcement is unpredictable and based on behavior frequency (e.g., gambling).
* **Effectiveness** :
  * **Variable schedules** (both interval and ratio) tend to be more effective in sustaining behavior compared to fixed schedules.
  *  **Continuous Reinforcement** : Every instance of behavior is reinforced, leading to strong learning, though it may not be practical in all situations.
* **Applications in Organizational Context** :
* **Shaping Behavior** : Reinforcement strategies are used to promote desired behaviors, such as following rules or maintaining cleanliness.
* **Challenges** : Improper timing or inconsistency in reinforcement can lead to extinction, where the connection between behavior and reinforcement weakens.

#### **3. Cognitive Theories of Learning**

* **Introduction** :
* Cognitive theories emphasize internal processes between stimulus and response, differing from the external focus of behavioristic theories.
* **Key Concepts** :
* **Latent Learning** :
  * Learning that occurs without immediate expression; behavior may only be exhibited when a relevant situation arises.
  * Example: Learning a word from a movie and using it later in a suitable context.
* **Cognitive Map** :
  * Mental representation of the external environment and its relationships.
  * Example: Visualizing consequences of actions in a chess game without physically moving the pieces.
* **Belief Systems** :
  * Internal frameworks guide expectations, such as belief in karma or the idea that hard work leads to rewards.

#### **4. Observational Learning (Vicarious Learning)**

* **Concept** :
* Learning through observing others rather than through direct experience.
* Example: Imitating behaviors of a movie hero after observing their positive outcomes.
* **Steps in Observational Learning** :
* **Attention** : Focusing on the behavior of others.
* **Retention** : Remembering the observed behavior.
* **Reproduction** : Imitating the behavior.
* **Reinforcement** : Positive outcomes reinforce the behavior, making it more likely to be repeated.

#### **5. Applications of Learning in Organizational Contexts**

* **Training Programs** :
* **Motivation** : Employees need to see the value in training for skill development and behavior change.
* **Periodic Training** : Regular training sessions help reinforce skills and prevent forgetting.
* **Practical Application** : Providing opportunities to apply learned skills in real situations (e.g., language skills).
* **Feedback** : Continuous feedback is essential to guide and improve performance.
* **Role Models and Mentoring** :
  *  **Role Models** : Observing someone who exemplifies the desired behavior can encourage others to adopt similar behaviors.
  *  **Mentoring** : Personalized guidance helps individuals apply and refine new skills effectively.

#### **6. Conclusion**

* **Summary** :
* The lecture covered a review of learning theories, including behavioristic (classical and operant conditioning), cognitive, and observational learning theories.
* Discussed the practical applications of these theories in an organizational context, particularly in training and behavior modification.
* **Next Steps** :
* The next chapter will focus on the application of learning principles to motivation within organizational behavior.
