### **Learning** - Organizational Behaviour

#### **1. Introduction to Learning**

* **Definition** :
* Learning is defined as a relatively permanent change in behavior that occurs as a result of experience. This change is enduring and impacts how individuals behave in various situations.

#### **2. Theories on Learning**

The chapter explores several theories of learning, each providing a different perspective on how individuals acquire and modify behavior.

* **Behavioristic Theories** :
* **Classical Conditioning** :
  * This theory, developed by Ivan Pavlov, involves pairing a neutral stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus to create a conditioned response. Over time, the neutral stimulus alone can evoke the response initially triggered only by the unconditioned stimulus.
* **Operant Conditioning** :
  * Also known as instrumental conditioning, this theory is based on the concept that behaviors are shaped by their consequences. Developed by B.F. Skinner, operant conditioning emphasizes the role of reinforcement and punishment in learning.
  *  **Law of Effect (Thorndike)** : Behaviors followed by desirable outcomes are likely to be repeated, while those followed by undesirable outcomes are less likely to occur.
  *  **Reinforcement** :
  * **Positive Reinforcement** : Strengthens behavior by providing a rewarding outcome.
  * **Negative Reinforcement** : Involves the removal of an undesirable outcome to encourage behavior (avoidance learning).
  * **Punishment** : Introducing an aversive consequence to decrease unwanted behavior.
  * **Extinction** : Gradual weakening of a behavior when it is no longer reinforced.
    *  **Using Punishment** :
  * Punishment is a complex and often misunderstood tool that can lead to negative side effects such as anxiety, aggression, or resentment.
  * It is recommended to use the  **Red-Hot-Stove Approach** :
    * **Warn** : Provide a clear warning before punishment.
    * **Prompt** : Administer punishment immediately after the behavior.
    * **Consistent** : Ensure that punishment is applied consistently.
    * **Impersonal** : Punishment should be applied fairly, regardless of who commits the behavior.
      *  **Schedules of Reinforcement** :
  * **Continuous Reinforcement** : Every instance of the desired behavior is reinforced.
  * **Partial Reinforcement** : Reinforcement is provided intermittently, following different schedules:
  * **Fixed Interval** : Rewards are given at set time intervals.
  * **Variable Interval** : Rewards are given at unpredictable time intervals.
  * **Fixed Ratio** : Rewards are given after a set number of responses.
  * **Variable Ratio** : Rewards are given after an unpredictable number of responses. Variable schedules are often more effective in sustaining behavior.
* **Cognitive Theories** :
* Focus on the internal mental processes that occur between stimulus and response, acknowledging that not all learning is observable.
* **Latent Learning** : Learning that occurs without immediate behavioral change but manifests when circumstances provide motivation.
* **Cognitive Map** : A mental representation of the environment, allowing individuals to navigate and anticipate outcomes based on internal expectations and external rewards.
* **Observational Learning** :
* Also known as **Modeling** or  **Vicarious Learning** , this theory, developed by Albert Bandura, suggests that people learn by observing the behaviors of others and the outcomes of those behaviors.
* **Steps in Observational Learning** :
  *  **Attention** : Focusing on the behavior being observed.
  *  **Retention** : Remembering the observed behavior.
  *  **Behavioral Reproduction** : Imitating the observed behavior.
  *  **Motivation** : Having a reason to replicate the behavior.

#### **3. Application of Learning Principles in Training**

* Learning principles are crucial in organizational training programs aimed at skill development and behavior modification.
* **Key Strategies** :
* **Motivate Participation** : Employees need to see value in training programs.
* **Periodical Training Programs** : Regular training helps reinforce skills and prevent forgetting.
* **Opportunities to Transfer Knowledge** : Practical application of learned skills in real work situations is essential.
* **Provide Feedback** : Continuous feedback ensures that employees are on the right track.
* **Role Models and Mentoring** : Having role models and mentors can greatly enhance the learning process by providing examples and personal guidance.

#### **4. Conclusion**

* The chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the various theories of learning and their practical applications in an organizational context. Understanding these theories is essential for effectively designing and implementing training programs that foster skill development and positive behavior change within organizations.

This review encapsulates the key concepts and applications discussed in the chapter on learning, providing a holistic understanding of the material.
