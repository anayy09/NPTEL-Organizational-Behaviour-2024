### Chapter 4: Learning (Part 1)

#### **1. Introduction to Learning**

* **Course Context** :
* The lecture is part of Chapter 4 of the Organizational Behaviour course, focusing on the concept of learning.
* Key topics covered include the definition of learning, theories of learning (behavioristic, cognitive, social learning), and applications in organizational behavior, especially in training programs.

#### **2. Defining Learning**

* **General Definition** :
* Learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior resulting from experience.
* Example: Learning traffic rules in a new city—once you learn a rule (e.g., a road being one-way), you adjust your behavior permanently.
* **Learning in Psychology** :
* Learning is one of the most important chapters in psychology, fundamental to understanding human behavior.
* Learning affects nearly all behaviors except for a few instinctual ones (e.g., sneezing, coughing).
* **Behavioristic View** :
* According to behavioristic theories, most behaviors are learned through experience.
* Humans are born as a "clean slate," acquiring attitudes, emotions, social norms, and behaviors through learning.

#### **3. Theories of Learning**

* **Overview** :
* The lecture covers three main theories: behavioristic (classical and operant conditioning), cognitive, and social learning theories.
* Each theory provides a different perspective on how learning occurs.

#### **4. Behavioristic Theories**

* **Classical Conditioning** :
* **Introduction** :
  * Developed by Ivan Pavlov in the late 1800s through experiments on dogs, originally aimed at studying digestion.
  *  **Experiment Summary** :
  * A dog was conditioned to associate the sound of a bell (neutral stimulus) with food (unconditioned stimulus), eventually leading the bell alone to trigger salivation (conditioned response).
* **Key Concepts** :
  *  **Unconditional Stimulus (UCS)** : A stimulus that naturally triggers a response (e.g., food causing salivation).
  *  **Unconditional Response (UCR)** : The natural response to the UCS (e.g., salivation).
  *  **Neutral Stimulus (NS)** : Initially does not trigger the target response (e.g., the bell).
  *  **Conditioned Stimulus (CS)** : After pairing with the UCS, the NS becomes a CS that triggers the response (e.g., bell causing salivation).
  *  **Conditioned Response (CR)** : The learned response to the CS (e.g., salivation in response to the bell).
* **Applications** :
  *  **Phobias** : Fear responses can be conditioned through early experiences (e.g., fear of water).
  *  **Habits** : Behaviors like nail-biting can be reinforced through associated positive outcomes.
  *  **Workplace Examples** : Conditioning can be used to reinforce positive behaviors (e.g., applause leading to repeated good performance).
* **Operant Conditioning** :
* **Introduction** :
  * Also known as instrumental conditioning or behavioral shaping, this theory focuses on the consequences of behavior.
  * A behavior is strengthened or weakened depending on the consequence that follows.
* **Key Concepts** :
  *  **Positive Reinforcement** : A desirable consequence that strengthens a behavior (e.g., a child receiving praise for good marks).
  *  **Negative Reinforcement** : Removal of an unpleasant outcome to strengthen behavior (e.g., avoiding traffic violations to retain a driver’s license).
  *  **Punishment** : An aversive consequence that weakens behavior (e.g., fines for breaking traffic rules).
  *  **Extinction** : The diminishing of a learned behavior when it is no longer reinforced (e.g., reduced appreciation leads to less helping behavior).
* **Reinforcement Methods** :
  *  **Positive Reinforcement** : Most effective and sustainable method.
  *  **Negative Reinforcement** : Effective in certain situations.
  *  **Punishment** : Least effective in the long term and can lead to negative consequences like anxiety, aggression, and resentment.
* **Effective Use of Punishment** :
  *  **Warn Beforehand** : Clearly define consequences before the behavior occurs.
  *  **Promptness** : Punishment should follow the behavior immediately.
  *  **Consistency** : Punishment should be consistently applied.
  *  **Impersonality** : Should be applied fairly to everyone, regardless of who commits the behavior.
* **Red Hot Stove Approach** :
  * An analogy where punishment is like a hot stove—it consistently burns anyone who touches it, immediately, and predictably.

#### **5. Conclusion**

* **Next Lecture** :
* The focus will be on the schedules of reinforcement in operant conditioning, discussing how to effectively schedule reinforcements to shape behavior.
