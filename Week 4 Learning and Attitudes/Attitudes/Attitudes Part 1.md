### Attitudes (Part 1)

#### **1. Introduction to Attitudes**

* **Course Context** :
* The lecture is part of Chapter 5, focusing on attitudes in the context of Organizational Behaviour.
* **Outline of the Chapter** :
  * Definition of attitude and key aspects.
  * Related concepts like beliefs and ideology.
  * Characteristics of attitudes.
  * Formation and measurement of attitudes.
  * Cognitive dissonance and its implications.
  * Changing attitudes and their role in the workplace.

#### **2. Defining Attitudes**

* **What Are Attitudes?** :
* Attitudes are evaluative mental statements or judgments we make about objects, people, or events.
* They are important because they often precede and influence behavior.
* Example: The global experience of COVID-19 led people to form various attitudes toward the virus, governments, and related events.
* **Key Characteristics** :
* **Evaluative Nature** : Attitudes involve judgments (e.g., for or against, good or bad).
* **Emotional and Cognitive Components** : Attitudes can evoke strong feelings (e.g., anger, anxiety) and are based on beliefs or information.
* **Attitude Formation** : People form attitudes based on their experiences, and these attitudes can vary in strength and be influenced by similar experiences.

#### **3. Elements of Attitude**

* **Cognitive Component** :
* Involves thoughts, beliefs, opinions, and information related to the attitude object.
* **Example** : Believing that a particular brand of smartphone has the best camera based on technical specifications (information) or personal preference (belief).
* **Affective Component** :
* Relates to emotions or feelings towards the attitude object.
* **Example** : Feeling excited or emotionally attached to a brand like Apple.
* **Behavioral Component** :
* Refers to the intention to behave in a certain way towards the attitude object.
* **Example** : Recommending a product to others or intending to purchase it based on positive attitudes.
* **Interaction of Components** :
* The affective component often strongly influences the other two components, as emotions can override rational thinking or intentions.

#### **4. Values and Their Relation to Attitudes**

* **What Are Values?** :
* Values are core beliefs about what is important, good, or desirable in life.
* They are more permanent and central to a personâ€™s identity than attitudes.
* **Examples** : Honesty, loyalty, material success.
* **Characteristics of Values** :
* **Core and Permanent** : Values are deeply embedded and resistant to change.
* **Influence on Attitudes** : Values shape the way individuals form attitudes toward various objects, events, or people.
* **Generic and Few** : Values are broad and fewer in number compared to attitudes, which are more specific and numerous.
* **Formation of Values** :
* Values are acquired through early life experiences, particularly through interactions with significant others, such as parents and peers.
* **Example** : Growing up in an environment that emphasizes honesty may lead to honesty becoming a core value.
* **Impact on Judgments** :
* Values help individuals set standards for competence (e.g., what defines success) and morality (e.g., what is right or wrong).
* **Example** : A person valuing honesty may judge others' actions based on how honest they appear.

#### **5. The Interaction Between Values and Attitudes**

* **Compartmentalization of Experiences** :
* Individuals use their values to categorize new information and experiences, which in turn influences their attitudes.
* **Example** : If a person values simplicity, they may prefer products that are functional and affordable rather than those that are luxurious.
* **Resistance to Change** :
* Since values are central to one's identity, they are difficult to change. Attitudes, while more stable than opinions, can be modified more easily with new information or persuasion.

#### **6. Summary and Conclusion**

* **Key Takeaways** :
* Attitudes are evaluative judgments formed through cognitive, affective, and behavioral components.
* Values are deep-seated beliefs that form the foundation for attitudes and are more resistant to change.
* Understanding attitudes and values is crucial in predicting behavior, especially in organizational settings.
