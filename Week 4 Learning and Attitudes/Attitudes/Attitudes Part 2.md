### Attitudes (Part 2)

#### **1. Recap of Previous Lecture**

* **Importance of Attitudes** :
* Attitudes significantly influence behavior and are not neutral; they always reflect a stance, either for or against something.
* **Definition** :
* Attitudes are evaluative judgments about people, objects, or events.
* **Connection Between Values and Attitudes** :
* Values, which are more stable and central to our identity, influence the formation of attitudes. Values define what we consider important in life, such as honesty, loyalty, or material success.

#### **2. Attitudes and Related Concepts**

* **Distinguishing Between Attitude and Opinion** :
* **Opinion** : A cognitive element of attitudes, often specific and based on personal judgments rather than objective facts.
* **Example** : "India is densely populated" is an opinion, while "India has a population of X million" is a factual statement.
* **Interaction** :
  *  **Attitudes Influence Opinions** : Pre-existing attitudes about a group can shape new opinions about individuals from that group.
  *  **Opinions Influence Attitudes** : Initial opinions, especially in new environments, can combine to form broader attitudes over time.
* **Beliefs and Ideology** :
* **Beliefs** :
  * Beliefs are judgments or assumptions about the truth of something. They are often emotionally neutral and are part of the cognitive component of attitudes.
  *  **Example** : Belief in the afterlife or in a certain concept of justice.
* **Ideology** :
  * A collection of beliefs that forms a comprehensive worldview, often influencing social and political behavior.
  *  **Examples** : Religions, political ideologies like communism or fascism.
  *  **Impact** :
  * Strong ideologies can lead to prejudice and influence attitudes, often resulting in fundamentalism where only one's own beliefs are considered correct.

#### **3. Attributes of Attitudes**

* **Valence** :
* Attitudes differ in intensity or the strength of favorability or unfavorability toward an object, event, or person.
* **Example** : Patriotism might evoke a stronger attitude compared to a preference for a mobile phone brand.
* **Multiplexity** :
* The complexity of an attitude based on the number of elements (cognitive, affective, behavioral) it contains.
* **Example** : Attitudes toward a country (patriotism) are likely more complex, involving beliefs, emotions, and behaviors, compared to a simpler attitude toward a product.
* **Centrality** :
* The importance of an attitude in a personâ€™s life, determining how central it is to their identity and decision-making.
* **Example** : Patriotism might be central to one's identity, influencing major life decisions more than preferences for consumer products.

#### **4. Formation of Attitudes**

* **Factors Influencing Attitude Formation** :
* **Personal Experience** :
  * Direct experiences, especially negative ones, can strongly shape attitudes toward people or social groups.
* **Social Influence** :
  *  **Family Members** : Early teachings and opinions shared by family members significantly influence attitude formation.
  *  **Peer Groups** : Friends and social circles reinforce attitudes, often leading to a selection of like-minded individuals.
* **Role Models** :
  * Public figures, teachers, and media personalities can influence attitudes, especially if they propagate similar beliefs.
* **Institutional Factors** :
  * Media and other institutional sources provide information that can shape attitudes, especially towards social groups or political issues.

#### **5. Measuring Attitudes**

* **Methods of Measurement** :
* **Surveys and Scales** :
  *  **Likert Scale** : A common method where respondents rate their agreement with statements on a scale (e.g., 1-5 or 1-7).
  *  **Objective vs. Subjective Measurement** :
  * **Objective** : Involves fixed-choice questions where responses can be easily quantified.
  * **Subjective** : Involves open-ended questions that allow for richer, more detailed responses but are harder to quantify.
* **Challenges in Measuring Attitudes** :
* **Social Desirability Effect** :
  * Respondents may provide socially acceptable answers rather than truthful ones, skewing results.
* **Sampling Issues** :
  * The sample selected for a survey may not accurately represent the larger population, leading to potential bias in the findings.

#### **6. Summary and Conclusion**

* **Key Points** :
* Attitudes are complex and formed through a combination of personal experience, social influence, and institutional factors.
* They can be measured through various methods, but challenges such as social desirability bias and sampling issues must be considered.
* **Next Steps** :
* The next session will delve deeper into these issues, with a focus on examples in an organizational context.
