**Recap of Previous Lecture:**

### **1. Psychological Motives in the Workplace:**

* **Focus on Psychological Factors** : Organizational Behaviour primarily examines the psychological factors influencing work behavior.

#### **A. Power Motive:**

* **Definition** : The need to control or reduce uncertainty in oneâ€™s life.
* **Explanation** :
* Power is the ability to control circumstances and reduce unpredictability.
* **Example** : Students aspiring to join prestigious institutions like IITs or IIMs to secure better job prospects and reduce career uncertainty.
* **Outcome** : More options, less uncertainty, and greater control over life choices.

#### **B. Achievement Motive:**

* **Definition** : The drive to excel and be the best in a particular task or role.
* **Characteristics** :
* **Moderate Risk Takers** : Prefer calculated risks rather than extreme ones.
* **Feedback Seekers** : Regularly seek feedback to improve performance.
* **Persistent and Disciplined** : Highly focused on tasks until completion and continuously strive for better performance.
* **Workplace Value** : Employees with high achievement motivation are valuable assets as they are internally driven to excel.

#### **C. Affiliation Motive:**

* **Definition** : The need to belong to a group or be associated with others.
* **Explanation** :
* **Example** : Students wanting to join prestigious institutions for the recognition and pride of being associated with an elite group.

### **2. Role Conflict and Its Impact on Behavior:**

#### **A. Role Conflict:**

* **Definition** : The stress or tension experienced when fulfilling multiple roles with conflicting demands.
* **Types** :
* **Intra-role Conflict** : Conflicting expectations within the same role (e.g., different stakeholders in a job expecting different outcomes).
* **Inter-role Conflict** : Conflicting demands between different roles (e.g., balancing responsibilities as a parent and a manager).
* **Impact** :
* Leads to prioritization and questioning of role expectations.
* Similar to cognitive dissonance, pushing individuals to seek clarity and improve role performance.

#### **B. Goal Conflict:**

* **Definition** : The situation where an individual faces conflicting goals.
* **Types** :
* **Approach-Approach Conflict** : Choosing between two equally desirable goals (e.g., choosing between two attractive job offers).
* **Avoidance-Avoidance Conflict** : Choosing between two equally undesirable goals (e.g., fulfilling a tight deadline at work while dealing with a family emergency).
* **Approach-Avoidance Conflict** : Choosing between a goal with both positive and negative aspects (e.g., a major career opportunity conflicting with a personal crisis).
* **Impact** :
* Forces individuals to make decisions based on their value system, leading to greater self-awareness and clarity in priorities.

#### **C. Frustration and Its Role as a Motivator:**

* **Definition** : The feeling of being blocked or hindered from achieving a goal.
* **Impact** :
* Can lead to aggression, but when managed positively, it fosters creativity and problem-solving.
* Many creative innovations arise from overcoming frustration or unexpected barriers.

### **3. The Role of Money as a Motivator:**

#### **A. Limitations of Money as a Sole Motivator:**

* **Restriction of Extra Role Performance** :
* **In-role Performance** : Tasks explicitly outlined in job descriptions.
* **Extra-role Performance** : Voluntary acts that contribute to organizational effectiveness (e.g., helping colleagues, conserving resources).
* **Impact of Monetary Rewards** :
  * Quantifying and rewarding extra-role behaviors can reduce intrinsic motivation.
  * Employees may begin to expect rewards for behaviors previously driven by internal satisfaction, leading to reduced engagement in these behaviors.

#### **B. Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation:**

* **Intrinsic Motivation** : Satisfaction derived from the task itself, often leading to long-term engagement and fulfillment.
* **Extrinsic Motivation** : External rewards such as money, which may not sustain motivation in the long run.

#### **C. Money as a Part of a Broader Motivation Strategy:**

* **Nature of Work** : Beyond a certain point, the nature of the work and job satisfaction become more important than financial rewards.
* **Effective Use of Money** :
* **Profit Sharing** : Relabeling monetary rewards to create a sense of ownership and belonging among employees.
* **Performance Bonuses** : Seen as fair and just, reinforcing the idea that hard work and performance are recognized.

### **Key Takeaways:**

* Psychological motives like power, achievement, and affiliation significantly influence workplace behavior.
* Role and goal conflicts can drive behavior by forcing individuals to prioritize and seek clarity in their values and roles.
* Frustration, when channeled positively, can lead to creativity and innovation.
* While money is an important motivator, relying solely on it can undermine intrinsic motivation and reduce overall engagement. A combination of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, along with a focus on the nature of work, leads to sustained motivation in the workplace.
