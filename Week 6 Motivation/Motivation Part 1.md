### **1. Definition of Motivation:**

* **Motivation** : A central theme in psychology, particularly in organizational behavior. It is the **willingness** of an individual to exert high levels of effort to achieve a goal.
* **Motive** : The reason or cause that drives an individual towards a goal. Motives are essentially the force that pushes us towards achieving our objectives.

### **2. Understanding Motivation in the Workplace:**

* **Common Perception** : Often, it is assumed that monetary incentives are the primary motivators for employees. The belief is that better pay and performance-linked bonuses will lead to higher productivity.
* **Critical View** : While money is a powerful motivator, it is not the only one. How money is offered (e.g., with recognition or appreciation) significantly affects motivation.
* **Complex Dynamics** : Motivation is not merely about financial rewards but involves a combination of factors, including recognition, personal goals, and the work environment.

### **3. The Concept of Need in Motivation:**

* **Need** : A state of deficiency that triggers a drive to fulfill it. Needs can be biological, psychological, or social.
* **Biological Need Example** : Thirst leading to drinking water.
* **Psychological Need Example** : The need for friendship to avoid loneliness.
* **Social Need Example** : The need for status and recognition in society.
* **Behavior and Need** : Every behavior is driven by a need to satisfy a deficiency. The strength of the motive determines the intensity of the behavior.

### **4. Types of Needs and Their Impact on Behavior:**

* **Hierarchy of Needs** : At any given time, an individual has multiple needs. The most dominant need at that moment drives behavior.
* **Example** : A need for job promotion may drive someone to work harder, but if a more immediate need (e.g., health) arises, it may take precedence.
* **Perception of Importance** :
* The importance of a need is subjective and varies between individuals based on their values and circumstances.
* **Example** : The value placed on a promotion may vary depending on personal and family circumstances.
* **Needs are Recurrent and Never Fully Satisfied** :
* Biological needs are recurrent (e.g., hunger), while psychological needs are often insatiable (e.g., the desire for new possessions).

### **5. Types of Motives:**

* **Primary Motives** :
* **Biological and Unlearned** : These are physiological needs present from birth, such as hunger, thirst, and comfort.
* **General Needs** :
* **May Be Biological or Learned** : Includes curiosity, the need for paternal care, and the need for manipulative activity (the need to do something productive).
* **Examples** :
  *  **Curiosity** : The drive to learn or explore, evident even in animals.
  *  **Paternal Need** : The drive to nurture others, which can manifest in various forms beyond just biological parenting.
* **Secondary Motives** :
* **Learned and Social** : These are developed through social interaction and cultural learning. Examples include the need for achievement, social status, and security.
* **Examples** :
  *  **Need for Achievement** : The drive to excel or achieve in a competitive environment.
  *  **Social Status** : The need for recognition and respect from others.

### **Conclusion and Upcoming Topics:**

* Motivation is a complex and multifaceted concept that goes beyond mere financial incentives. Understanding the different types of needs and motives is crucial for effectively motivating individuals in an organizational setting.
* **Next Lecture** : The focus will be on a deeper exploration of different types of motives and their influence on behavior.

### **Key Takeaways:**

* Motivation is essential for improving employee performance in organizations, but it is not solely driven by money.
* Needs are the underlying drivers of motivation, and they can be biological, psychological, or social.
* The importance of needs varies between individuals and situations, influencing the intensity and direction of their behavior.
* Motives can be categorized into primary (biological), general (biological or learned), and secondary (learned) motives, each playing a significant role in shaping behavior.
