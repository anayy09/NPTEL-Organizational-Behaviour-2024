#### 1. Introduction to Perception

- **Perception** is a critical topic in Organizational Behaviour, impacting social relationships and behaviour within organizations.
- **Perception** in everyday language: Commonly used term referring to how we interpret sensory stimuli.

#### 2. Definition and Importance of Perception

- **Definition**: Perception is giving meaning to sensory stimuli.
  - Example: Seeing the brand name "IBM" from disconnected blue horizontal lines.
- **Subjectivity**: Perception varies between individuals based on background, experience, context, etc.
  - Example: Interpreting a loud noise differently based on the context and past experiences.

#### 3. Subjectivity of Perception

- **Understanding of Reality**: Varies from person to person; no single objective reality.
  - Example: Optical illusions showing different perceptions.
- **Impact on Communication**: Subjective perceptions can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts.
- **Workplace Relevance**: Recognizing the subjective nature of perception can improve communication and reduce conflicts.

#### 4. Perception Process

- **Definition**: The process of organizing and interpreting sensory stimuli.
- **Steps in Perception**:
  1. **Selection and Screening**: Choosing specific stimuli to focus on.
     - Example: Not noticing a fan until it stops working.
  2. **Organizing and Interpreting**: Making sense of the selected stimuli.
     - Example: Interpreting a power cut based on multiple sensory inputs.

#### 5. Internal and External Factors Influencing Perception

- **External Factors**: Characteristics of the stimulus or context.

  - **Intensity**: Strong stimuli capture attention (e.g., loud noises, bright lights).
  - **Size**: Larger stimuli are more noticeable (e.g., large billboards).
  - **Contrast**: Extreme differences in stimuli (e.g., contrasting colors).
  - **Repetition**: Repeated stimuli are more noticeable (e.g., frequent ads).
  - **Motion**: Moving stimuli attract attention (e.g., moving lights).
  - **Novelty and Familiarity**: New or familiar stimuli capture attention (e.g., new model bike or familiar brand).
- **Internal Factors**: Characteristics within the individual.

  - **Habit**: Routine behaviours attract attention (e.g., smokers noticing smoking areas).
  - **Motivation and Interest**: Needs and interests influence attention (e.g., thirst influencing attention to beverage ads).
  - **Learning**: Learned preferences attract attention (e.g., spiritual person noticing places of worship).
  - **Role and Specialization**: Professional roles influence attention (e.g., HR manager focusing on HR reports).

#### 6. Elements of Perception

- **Gestalt Theory**: People make sense of things by selecting certain elements and combining them to form a whole.
  - **Key Principle**: "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."

#### Practical Exercise:

- Reflect on a personal experience where differences in perception led to a problem or confusion. Consider:
  - The situation and the perceptions involved.
  - The resolution, if applicable.

#### Conclusion:

- Understanding perception is crucial in both social and organizational contexts to improve communication, reduce conflicts, and leverage diverse viewpoints for better decision-making.
