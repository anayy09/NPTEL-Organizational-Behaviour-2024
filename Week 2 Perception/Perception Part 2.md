### 1. Summary of Previous Lecture

- **Perception**: Defined as giving meaning to sensory stimuli by organizing and interpreting them.
- **Importance in Workplace**: Miscommunications can arise due to subjective nature of perception.
- **Elements of Perception**:
  - Selection and screening of information.
  - Organization of selected stimuli.
- **Factors Influencing Perception**:
  - **External Factors**: Related to the stimuli (e.g., intensity, size, contrast).
  - **Internal Factors**: Related to the individual (e.g., motivation, interest).

### 2. Perceptual Organization

- **Perceptual Organization**: After selecting stimuli, they are organized to create meaningful patterns.
- **Importance**: Helps in making sense of the environment by grouping stimuli.

### 3. Gestalt Principles of Perceptual Organization

- **Gestalt Theory**: Suggests people make sense of stimuli by organizing them into a whole.

#### Key Principles:

1. **Proximity**: Grouping stimuli based on how close they are.
   - Example: Seeing two black blocks together as one entity.
2. **Similarity**: Grouping similar stimuli together.
   - Example: Grouping similar-looking objects.
3. **Symmetry**: Grouping objects that form a symmetrical pattern.
4. **Good Continuation**: Grouping based on perceived continuous flow.
   - Example: Perceiving a continuous line even if there's a gap.
5. **Common Fate**: Grouping stimuli moving in the same direction.
6. **Perceptual Closure**: Filling in gaps to create a whole image.
   - Example: Completing a broken telephone conversation based on context.
7. **Figure and Ground**: Differentiating an object (figure) from its background.
   - Example: Seeing a vase versus two faces in a picture.
8. **Perceptual Constancy**: Maintaining constancy in perception despite changes.
   - Example: Recognizing a door as a rectangle despite its changed shape in an image.

### 4. Optical Illusions and Perceptual Errors

- **Optical Illusions**: Misleading perceptions due to the organization principles.
  - Example: Seeing different sizes of circles or different images in the same picture.

### 5. Social Perception

- **Social Perception**: Integrating and interpreting information about others to understand them.
  - **Importance**: Humans have a natural curiosity to understand others.
  - **Process**: Collecting, combining, and interpreting information.

### 6. Social Identity and Attribution

- **Social Identity**: How individuals define themselves in relation to social groups.
  - **Identity Exercise**: Writing statements starting with "I am" to explore self-identity.
  - **Importance**: Social groups influence personal identity and perception of others.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Social Identity Theory**: People define themselves and others based on personal qualities and social group affiliations.
   - **Stereotyping**: Generalizing qualities based on social identity.
     - Example: Assuming all Punjabis are athletic.
   - **In-group Bias**: Favoring one's own social group over others.
     - Example: Justifying actions of someone from your own social group differently than someone from another group.

#### Problems with Social Identity:

- **Biases and Stereotyping**: Can lead to inaccurate or unfair judgments.
- **In-group Bias**: Interpreting behaviors of in-group members more favorably than out-group members.

### Homework

- **Read about Attribution of Causality**: Understanding the causes behind behaviors, both of others and oneself.
- **Keyword**: "Attribution of cause" or "Attribution of causality."

---

### Summary of Covered Concepts:

- **Perceptual Organization**: Grouping and organizing stimuli using Gestalt principles.
- **Optical Illusions**: Misleading perceptions from perceptual organization.
- **Social Perception**: Understanding others through integrating information.
- **Social Identity and Stereotyping**: Defining oneself and others based on social groups and the biases that can result.
