### 1. Summary of Previous Lectures

- **Perception**: Defined as giving meaning to sensory stimuli, subjective in nature.
- **Importance in Workplace**: Understanding perception helps managers make better decisions.
- **Two Major Sections**:
  1. Technicalities of sensory perception.
  2. Social perception.
- **Steps in Perception**: Selection and organization of stimuli.
- **Gestalt Principles**: Used for organizing sensory stimuli, also applicable to social perception.
- **Principles**:
  - Perceptual constancy
  - Perceptual closure

### 2. Perceptual Organization

- **Gestalt Theories**: Humans use principles like proximity, similarity, symmetry, etc., to organize stimuli.
- **Social Context**: These principles apply to understanding social interactions as well.

### 3. Social Perception

- **Definition**: Perception in a social context, involving understanding ourselves and others.
- **Key Concepts**:
  1. **Personal Identity**: Individual characteristics.
  2. **Social Identity**: Characteristics related to the social group.
- **Social Identity Theory**: Understanding oneself and others through personal and social identity.
- **Stereotyping**: Judging individuals based on social group characteristics.

### 4. Attribution of Causality

- **Definition**: Understanding the cause behind behaviors.
- **Kelley's Theory**:
  - **Consensus**: Do others behave the same way?
  - **Consistency**: Does this behavior occur consistently over time?
  - **Distinctiveness**: Is this behavior unique to a particular situation?

#### Example:

- **Scenario**: New employee perceives their boss as irritable.
- **Analysis**:
  - **Consensus**: Do others also find the boss irritable?
  - **Consistency**: Is the boss always irritable?
  - **Distinctiveness**: Is the boss irritable only towards the new employee or towards everyone?

#### Combinations:

1. **Low Consensus, Low Distinctiveness, High Consistency**: Internal cause (employee's perception).
2. **High Consensus, High Distinctiveness, High Consistency**: External cause (boss's behavior).
3. **High Consensus, Low Distinctiveness, Low Consistency**: Situational factors.

### 5. Perceptual Biases

- **Fundamental Attribution Error**: Attributing others' behavior to internal causes while ignoring external factors.
- **Halo Effect**: Generalizing based on one positive trait.
- **Team Halo Effect**: Attributing team success to the team and failures to external factors.
- **Similar-to-Me Effect**: Favoring those who are similar to oneself.
- **Selective Perception**: Selecting only certain information while ignoring others.
- **First Impression Error**: Judging based on initial encounters and maintaining that judgment.

### 6. Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

- **Definition**: Expectations about someone can influence their behavior to align with those expectations.

#### Examples:

1. **Pygmalion Effect**: Higher expectations lead to better performance.
   - **Example**: Teachers expecting certain students to be better learners, and those students performing better.
2. **Golem Effect**: Lower expectations lead to poorer performance.
   - **Example**: Setting low standards for employees, leading to lower performance.

### Summary of Covered Concepts

- **Attribution Process**: How we attribute causes to behavior using consensus, consistency, and distinctiveness.
- **Perceptual Biases**: Various biases that affect social perception.
- **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**: How perceptions can influence behavior and become reality.
