### What is Perception?

- Process of giving meaning to sensory stimuli through organizing and interpreting.
- It is how we ‘see’ things.
- Perception is an individual’s view of reality.
- It is highly subjective.
- **Role of Perceptions at Workplace**:
  - Influences decision-making, communication, and interaction.

### Basic Elements of Perception

1. **Selection and Screening of Information**
2. **Organization of Stimuli**

**Sub-processes of Perception**:

- **Stimulus**
- **Registration**
- **Interpretation**
- **Feedback**
- **Consequence** (the response)

---

### Principles of Perceptual Selection

- **How We Select the Stimulus?**
  - **External Factors**:

    - Intensity
    - Size
    - Contrast
    - Repetition
    - Motion
    - Novelty and Familiarity
  - **Internal Factors**:

    - Habit
    - Motivation and Interest
    - Learning
    - Organizational Role and Specialization

---

### Perceptual Organization

- **Grouping**
- **Closure**
- **Figure-ground**
- **Perceptual Constancy**

**Examples**:

- **Perceptual Grouping**
- **Perceptual Closure**
- **Figure-ground**
- **Perceptual Constancy**

**Challenges**:

- Optical Illusions

---

### Social Perception

- **Definition**: The process of combining, integrating, and interpreting information about others to gain an accurate understanding of them.
- **Attribution**: The process through which individuals attempt to determine the causes behind others’ behavior.

---

### Social Identity

- **Personal Identity**: Characteristics that define a particular individual.
- **Social Identity**: Defining a person in the context of their membership in various social groups.
- **Social Identity Theory**: We perceive ourselves and others based on both our unique characteristics (personal identity) and our membership in various groups (social identity).

---

### The Attribution Process

- **Internal Vs External Causes**
- **Kelley’s Theory of Causal Attribution**:
  - **Consensus**: The extent to which other people behave in the same manner as the person we are judging.
  - **Consistency**: How consistently the person exhibits the behavior in similar contexts.
  - **Distinctiveness**: The extent to which a person behaves in the same manner in other contexts.

**Attribution of Cause**:

- Low Consensus, Low Distinctiveness, High Consistency = Personal Attribution
- High Consensus, High Distinctiveness, High Consistency = Stimulus Attribution
- High Consensus, Low Distinctiveness, Low Consistency = Circumstance Attribution

---

### Perceptual Biases in Social Perception

- **Fundamental Attribution Error**: The tendency to attribute others’ actions to internal causes while largely ignoring external factors.
- **Halo Effect**: Overall impressions of others affecting specific judgments.
- **Team Halo Effect**: The tendency for people to credit teams for their successes but not hold them accountable for their failures.
- **Similar-to-me Effect**: Perceiving people who are similar to us in a positive light.
- **Selective Perception**: The tendency to focus on some aspects of the environment while ignoring others.
- **First-Impression Error**

---

### Power of Perception

- **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**
  - **Pygmalion Effect**
  - **Golem Effect**

---

### Job Stereotypes

---

### Stereotyping

- **Definition**: A belief that all members of specific groups share similar traits and are prone to behave the same way.
- **Negative Impact**:
  - Selective Perception
  - Bias and Prejudice

---

### Some Implications for HR

- **Impression Management Techniques**
- **Bias and Stereotyping during Selection and Appraisal**

**Examples**:

- **Stethoscope**: Often associated with doctors.
- **Sewing Machine**: Often associated with women in a domestic context.

---

### Conclusion

- **Perception**: A critical aspect of organizational behavior influencing decision-making and interactions.
- **Awareness**: Understanding perceptual biases and stereotypes can improve HR practices and workplace interactions.
