### Emotions at Workplace - Part 3

#### **1. Recap of Previous Lectures**

* **Importance of Emotions** : Emotions play a crucial role in our lives, affecting our behavior and interactions.
* **Contagious Nature of Emotions** : Emotions can easily spread from person to person, particularly in the workplace, where managing emotions becomes vital.
* **Types of Emotions** : Emotions are classified into self-conscious and social emotions. Emotions are specific and temporary, while moods are generalized and last longer.
* **Spillover Effect** : Emotions in one sphere of life (e.g., family) can affect performance and emotions in another sphere (e.g., work). This spillover can be positive or negative.
* **Emotional Labor** : Involves managing emotions to align with job requirements. It can be done through surface acting, deep acting, or genuinely feeling the emotions. Emotional dissonance occurs when there's a mismatch between felt and expressed emotions.
* **Negative Emotions** : Focus on negative emotions like anger and aggression, their impact on workplace behavior, and how to manage them through assertiveness rather than aggression.

#### **2. Introduction to Workplace Stress**

* **Importance of Workplace Stress** : Research on workplace stress gained momentum in the 1960s-80s, particularly focusing on its biological impacts. Stress is considered an occupational hazard, similar to physical hazards in the workplace.
* **Occupational Hazard** : Traditionally, occupational hazards were viewed as physical (e.g., injuries from accidents). However, stress represents a psychological hazard with real physiological impacts (e.g., heart attacks, ulcers).

#### **3. Organizational Responsibility and Stress**

* **Debate on Responsibility** : There's debate over whether organizations are responsible for stress-related health issues. Some argue that since stress is subjective, employees should manage their stress. However, stress can lead to significant health problems, making it an occupational hazard that organizations should address.
* **Managing Workplace Stress** : Organizations can help by providing stress management training, improving work structures, and ensuring managers adopt effective and empathetic management styles.

#### **4. The Impact of Modern Work Environments**

* **Sedentary Work** : Modern white-collar jobs often involve long hours of sitting, leading to health issues like obesity, heart problems, and diabetes. Sitting for extended periods is considered as harmful as smoking.
* **Disrupted Sleep Cycles** : The shift in work patterns, including late hours and night shifts, disrupts circadian rhythms, leading to immune system issues and other health problems.
* **Lifestyle Changes** : Work-related lifestyle changes, such as irregular sleep patterns and excessive partying on weekends, can exacerbate stress and health issues.

#### **5. Understanding Stress**

* **Definition of Stress** : Stress is a non-specific biological response to a perceived or real threat. It triggers a series of physiological reactions designed to prepare the body for a fight or flight response.
* **Physiological Reactions** : Stress triggers changes such as increased heart rate, shallow breathing, sweating, and other biochemical responses, driven by the release of hormones like adrenaline.

#### **6. Stages of Stress Response**

* **Alarm Reaction** : The initial stage where the body becomes alert, preparing for action (fight or flight). This stage involves adrenaline discharge and physiological changes like increased heart rate and dilated pupils.
* **Resistance Stage** : If the stress persists, the body tries to resist and adapt to the stress, attempting to return to normal (homeostasis).
* **Exhaustion Stage** : Prolonged stress leads to the depletion of the body's resources, resulting in physical and psychological collapse, similar to a rubber band losing its elasticity after being stretched too long.

#### **7. Types of Stress**

* **Eustress** : Positive stress resulting from positive events (e.g., a promotion or winning a lottery). It can be overwhelming but is generally perceived positively.
* **Distress** : Negative stress caused by adverse events (e.g., job loss, illness, or accidents).
* **Hyperstress** : Stress from excessive work pressure or overload.
* **Hypostress** : Stress from a lack of stimulation or challenge, often leading to boredom and frustration.

#### **8. Causes of Stress**

* **Organizational and Job-Related Factors** : Demanding jobs, multitasking, organizational changes, uncertainty, and job cuts can all contribute to workplace stress.
* **Life Stress** : Major life changes (e.g., becoming a parent, losing a loved one, relocating) can cause significant stress.
* **Daily Stressors** : Everyday issues like commuting, time management, and lack of sleep can accumulate and contribute to overall stress levels.
* **Personal Stress** : Personal factors such as aging, health issues, and new responsibilities (e.g., parenthood) can also lead to stress.

#### **9. Consequences of Stress**

* **Psychological Effects** : Stress can lead to low productivity, absenteeism, irritability, depression, burnout, and feelings of isolation.
* **Physical Effects** : Stress can cause sleep disturbances, high blood pressure, diabetes, back pain, bowel issues, and sexual dysfunction. Prolonged stress has severe health implications.

#### **10. Managing Stress**

* **Self-Awareness** : Recognizing what triggers stress and understanding how to manage those triggers can reduce stress. Time management and assertiveness can be key strategies.
* **Mindfulness** : Practicing mindfulness involves staying aware of stress triggers and consciously managing physiological reactions (e.g., deep breathing) to reduce stress.
* **Biofeedback Mechanism** : Techniques like deep breathing can help control physiological responses to stress, breaking the cycle of stress-induced reactions.
* **Lifestyle Changes** : Incorporating regular exercise, maintaining a healthy sleep routine, and avoiding prolonged periods of inactivity can help mitigate stress. Standing desks and regular movement breaks are recommended for sedentary jobs.
* **Positive Coping Mechanisms** : Engaging in positive activities like exercise, rather than negative habits like smoking or drinking, can effectively manage stress.

#### **11. Conclusion**

* **Organizational Role** : Organizations have a responsibility to ensure optimal stress levels among employees to maintain productivity and well-being.
* **Personal Takeaways** : Managing stress is crucial for both psychological and physiological health. Personal awareness and lifestyle adjustments are essential tools for managing stress effectively.
