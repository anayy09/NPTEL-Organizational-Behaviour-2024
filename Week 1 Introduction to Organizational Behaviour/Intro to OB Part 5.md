# Organizational Behaviour - Week 1.5: Introduction to Organizational Behaviour (Part 5)

## Key Points from Previous Lecture

- **Industrial Psychology and Organizational Behaviour**:
  - OB emerged from industrial psychology but is multidisciplinary, involving sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics, and other social sciences.
  - Frederick Taylor's scientific management principles and their application in Ford's organization.
  - Criticisms of Taylorism, particularly its dehumanizing approach to workers.

## Criticisms of Scientific Management

- **Treating Humans as Machines**:
  - Workers seen as replaceable parts of a larger machine.
  - Lack of power and voice for workers.
- **Time and Motion Study**:
  - Standardizing tasks based on laboratory conditions is not applicable to real-world scenarios.
  - Psychological and social factors are not considered.
- **Assembly Line**:
  - Facilitates mass production but leads to boredom and a lack of meaningful work for employees.
  - Makes workers easily replaceable, reducing their negotiation power.
- **Relative Performance Evaluation**:
  - Incentivizing high performers can demotivate the majority.
  - Continuously raising benchmarks can lead to unrealistic expectations and burnout.
- **Union Busting**:
  - Ford's company discouraged unionization, viewing unions as unnecessary.
  - Importance of unions in representing employees' voices and ensuring continuous improvement.

## Important Concepts from the Video

- **Time and Motion Study**:
  - Breaking down jobs into specific tasks and measuring time taken.
  - Criticized for not considering real-world complexities and individual differences.
- **Assembly Line**:
  - Enabled mass production and cost efficiency.
  - Negative impact on employee morale and sense of meaning in their work.
- **Incentives for Performance**:
  - Rewarding high performers can create unrealistic benchmarks and demotivate others.
- **Union Representation**:
  - Unions play a crucial role in voicing employees' concerns and fostering organizational growth.
  - Management needs to listen to employees for realistic information and continuous improvement.

## Human Relations Movement

- **Shift from Taylorism**:
  - Post-1930s, a shift towards viewing employees as psychosocial beings rather than mere components of a machine.
  - Human relations movement emphasized social and psychological aspects of work.
- **Hawthorne Experiments**:
  - Conducted by Elton Mayo and others at the Hawthorne Western Electric Company.
  - Showed that social and psychological factors significantly impact employee performance.
  - **Hawthorne Effect**: Performance improves when individuals feel observed and valued.
  - Key Finding: Employees' sense of importance and belonging plays a crucial role in their performance.

## Evolution of OB as a Discipline

- **Interdisciplinary Nature**:
  - OB has become an interdisciplinary field, integrating insights from various social sciences.
- **Technological Changes and Globalization**:
  - Modern challenges include managing technological advancements, globalization, cultural diversity, and ethical management.
  - Importance of fostering collaboration, inclusivity, and ethical behaviour in organizations.
