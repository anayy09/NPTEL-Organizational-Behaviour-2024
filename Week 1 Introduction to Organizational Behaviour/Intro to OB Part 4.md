## Frederick Taylor and Scientific Management

- **Principles of Scientific Management**:

  - Frederick Taylor proposed four key principles to improve industrial efficiency:
    1. **Scientific Job Analysis**: Break down each job into subtasks, identify the best methods, and eliminate unnecessary tasks.
    2. **Scientific Selection and Training**: Recruit individuals capable of performing tasks within established timeframes and train them accordingly.
    3. **Cooperation Between Workers and Management**: Ensure workers follow proper methods and cooperate with management to maintain performance standards.
    4. **Separation of Planning and Doing**: Management makes decisions based on scientific methods, while workers focus on performing their tasks.

  - However, led to criticisms such as treating workers like machines and causing a loss of individuality and powerlessness among employees.
