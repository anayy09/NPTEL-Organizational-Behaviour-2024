# Organizational Behaviour - Week 1.3: Introduction to Organizational Behaviour (Part 3)

## Homework Review: Influence of Social Groups on Individual Behaviour

- **Question**: Do larger social groups influence individual behaviour, or do individuals influence larger social groups?
- **Answer**: Both statements are correct.
  - **Larger Social Groups Influence Individual Behaviour**:
    - Example: Organizational culture and social norms.
    - Newcomers adapt to existing cultural norms, such as addressing supervisors with titles like "sir" or "ma'am."
  - **Individuals Influence Larger Social Groups**:
    - Example: Evolution of culture through individual behaviours.
    - New leaders can instigate cultural change.

## Importance of Understanding Interdependency

- **Critical Understanding**:
  - Recognizing the influence between individuals and larger social groups is crucial for understanding human behaviour.
  - Both top-down (macro influences) and bottom-up (micro influences) perspectives are necessary.

## Why Study Organizational Behaviour (OB)?

- **Relevance for Students**:
  - Organizational behaviour concepts apply even in educational settings.
  - Understanding group dynamics, building trust, and interpreting influences can benefit students.
- **Relevance for Working Professionals**:
  - OB helps understand and manage employee behaviour.
  - Key areas of application: human resource management, selection, performance evaluation, and employee welfare.

## Example: Middle-Level Management Attrition

- **Problem**: High attrition rates among middle-level managers in large manufacturing organizations.
- **Understanding the Problem**:
  - Attrition at this level is costly due to the loss of experienced and connected employees.
  - **Reason**: Career stagnation and lack of growth opportunities.
- **Application of OB Theory**:
  - **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs**: At this stage, employees seek recognition and growth.
  - **Intervention**: Job rotation, offering new responsibilities, and continuous learning opportunities.

## Application Areas of OB in HRM

1. **Selection**:
   - Matching personality and attitude to job requirements.
   - Psychometric testing to evaluate suitability.
   - Overcoming biases in interviews (e.g., stereotyping).
2. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Defining performance criteria beyond tangible outputs.
   - Addressing evaluation biases (e.g., halo effect).
3. **Employee Welfare**:
   - Stress management and preventing burnout.
   - Understanding work-life balance and its impact on overall performance.

## Improving Quality of Work Life

- **Workplace vs. Workspace**:
  - **Workplace**: Physical environment, organizational culture, and interpersonal relationships.
  - **Workspace**: Influence of work on personal life and vice versa.
- **Goal**: Enhance employee performance, commitment, and loyalty.

## Homework

- - **Question**: Why did World Wars contribute to developments in industrial psychology?
  - Reflect on the influence of major historical events on the evolution of OB.
