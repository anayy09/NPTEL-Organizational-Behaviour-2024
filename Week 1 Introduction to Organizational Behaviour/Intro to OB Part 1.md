## Defining an Organization

### Initial Thoughts on Organization

- **Key Terms Associated with Organization**:
  - Collaboration
  - Coordination
  - Collective Effort
  - Arrangement of People

### Simple Definition of Organization

- **Group of People**: Coming together to achieve a common goal.

### Elaborate Definition of Organization

- **Origin of the Term**:
  - Comes from "organizing"
  - Part of five management functions: planning, organizing, leading, controlling, coordinating.

### What is Organizing?

- **Definition**: Arranging tasks, people, and authority in a systematic manner.
- **Key Aspects**:
  - **Tasks**: Defined and assigned to specific designations.
  - **People**: Given specific designations.
  - **Authority**: Levels of power assigned to execute tasks.

### Deliberate Arrangement

- **Meaning**: Rational and logical arrangement of tasks, people, and authority.
- **Example**: Family vs. Organization
  - Family: Not systematically defined; roles assumed through mutual understanding.
  - Organization: Systematically defined, planned, and arranged.

### Elaborate Definition of Organization

- **Defined As**: A consciously coordinated social entity with an identifiable boundary that functions on a relatively continuous basis to achieve a common goal or set of goals.

#### Key Terms in Definition

1. **Consciously Coordinated**:

   - **Systematic Processes**: Rational processes to operate day-to-day activities.
   - **Challenge**: Many organizations also operate through mutual understanding and unplanned actions.
2. **Social Entity**:

   - **Meaning**: Involves people.
   - **Question**: How many people constitute an organization? Small groups like project teams might not qualify as organizations.
3. **Identifiable Boundary**:

   - **Physical Boundary**: Place from which they operate.
   - **Social Boundary**: Sense of belongingness.
   - **Challenge**: Virtual organizations challenge the need for physical boundaries; social belongingness is subjective.
4. **Continuous Basis**:

   - **Meaning**: Exists for a long duration.
   - **Challenge**: Lifespan of organizations is becoming shorter.
5. **Goals**:

   - **Whose Goals?**: Different stakeholders have different goals.
   - **Example**: Employees, shareholders, and customers have varied goals.

### Summary of Organization Definition

- **Complexity**: Defining an organization is complex due to evolving forms of organizations and varying definitions.
