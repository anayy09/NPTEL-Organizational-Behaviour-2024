# Organizational Behaviour - Week 1.2: Introduction to Organizational Behaviour (Part 2)

## Importance of Understanding Complexity

- **Emerging Forms of Organizations**: Newer forms of organizations influence how people behave within them.
- **Critical Thinking**: Understanding complexity aids in critically evaluating theories and their contexts.
- **Context-Specific Knowledge**: Theories and research findings are often context-specific.

## Homework Review: Is a Country an Organization?

- **Question**: Classify a country as a social group or an organization.
- **Answer**: A country is not an organization, but a government is.
  - **Reason**: A country lacks the deliberate coordination and specific task descriptions characteristic of an organization.
  - **Role**: Citizens do not have clear-cut roles like members of an organization.
  - **Goals**: Goals of a country are broadly prescribed, unlike the specific goals of an organization.

## Organizational Behaviour (OB)

- **Definition Recap**: OB is the study of human behaviour in organizational settings.
- **Multidisciplinary Nature**: OB integrates inputs from psychology, sociology, anthropology, management, economics, etc.
- **Major Contributor**: Psychology significantly contributes to OB.

## Key Assumptions of OB

1. **Organizations Consist of People**:
   - Organizations range from one person to thousands of people.
2. **Motivated People Work Effectively**:
   - Common belief: Happy people perform better.
   - Critical View: Effectiveness vs. Efficiency.
3. **Disparity Between Organizational and Individual Goals**:
   - Challenge: Aligning individual goals with organizational goals.
4. **Impact of Policies and Procedures on People**:
   - Individual differences lead to varied reactions to policies.
   - Example: Working from home policy may not suit everyone.

## Key Concepts in OB

1. **Individual Differences**:
   - Each person is unique, which complicates generalizations.
   - Contextual understanding is crucial.
2. **Multiple Roles of Employees**:
   - Designation vs. Role: Social expectations vs. formal positions.
   - Role Conflict: Inter-role (between roles) and intra-role (within the same role).
3. **Motivation as a Force**:
   - Motivated employees are more effective than merely efficient.
4. **Human Dignity**:
   - Ethical treatment and respect for employees.

## Levels of Analysis in OB

1. **Individual Level**:
   - Personality, attitude, motivation.
2. **Group Level**:
   - Team dynamics, conflict resolution, leadership qualities.
3. **Organizational Level**:
   - How individual and group behaviours influence organizational processes.

## Homework

- **Question**: Do larger organizational processes influence individual behaviour, or do individuals change larger organizational processes?
- **Consideration**: Top-down vs. bottom-up influence.
